Personally, I like to have an idea how often I use a specific bike and how many miles I ride with it during the course of the year. Strava has that data, but unfortunately doesn't present it to you. I spent a couple of hours with <a href="https://www.klipfolio.com/">Klipfolio</a> and whipped up a dashboard for myself.</p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://live.staticflickr.com/4880/44767692020_0c288cb262_b.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Klipfolio Strava dashboard version 6 (last one)." width="1023" height="907"><figcaption>Klipfolio Strava dashboard version 6 (last one).</figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/tags/klipfolio">Screenshot</a>, since the dashboard was accessible to nobody but me. Sadly, Klipfolio sunsetted the freemium accounts at the end of April 2019 and their basic account package is $49 a month. It was a great tool to have, but their pricing is definitely geared towards business users.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 29, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://collideous.github.io/tags/cycling/">cycling</a></li><li><a href="https://collideous.github.io/tags/statistics/">statistics</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://collideous.github.io/media/website/profile.picture.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Patrick Strahm"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://collideous.github.io/authors/patrick-strahm/" class="invert" rel="author">Patrick Strahm</a></h3><p>Mountains are not stadiums where I satisfy my ambition to achieve, they are the cathedrals where I practice my religion.</p></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://collideous.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://collideous.github.io/custom-carbon-front-light-mount/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Custom Carbon Front Light Mount</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://collideous.github.io/a-bike-jacket-for-next-winter/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> A Bike Jacket For Next Winter </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://collideous.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2020-09-28T22:12" class="feed__date">September 28, 2020</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://collideous.github.io/ride-type-statistics/" class="invert">Ride Type Statistics</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-09-03T09:27" class="feed__date">September 3, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://collideous.github.io/allroad-cycling/" class="invert">AllRoad Cycling</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="post__comments"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5">Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
