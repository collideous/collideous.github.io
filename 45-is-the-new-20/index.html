The larger wheels moved the whole cockpit upwards and out of necessity the flat bar returned.</p><p>During my mountain biking career I went through all the above. When my <a href="https://collideous.github.io/tags/single-speeding/">single-speed</a> mountain bikes started rolling on 29 inch wheels, I started out with flat bars with a sweep in the neighborhood of 12 degrees. In 2012 I swapped those bars for Answer Carbon 720 20/20 with a 20mm rise and a 20° back sweep. It was instant love and I used them for several years. Always intrigued by Jeff Jones' H-bars and the arguments he made for them, I decided to give them a try this year.<br><br>I bought Jones' aluminum H-Bar Bend 710 model, which is as the name suggests 710mm wide and like every Jones handlebar comes with a 45° back sweep. Stem length unchanged, this puts the hands much closer to the body and puts the rider in a more upright position. For a single-speed rider like myself, the hand position allows one's back - and upper body in general - to do a lot more work while climbing out of the saddle. Think of a rower pulling a pair of oars. This is much harder to do when hunched over like the traditional XC rider position. The Jones H-Bar allows you to use arms and upper body to get more power to the pedals. Climbing though is not the only thing at which the handlebar excels. The huge rearward sweep is just as much about improved control while descending or riding technical single-track.<br><br>Such a radical change in hand position can take some time to get used to. Jeff Jones says riders should give themselves up to a month to adjust. The very first time I sat on the bike, the bar indeed felt a little awkward. But three short trial rides just on my neighborhood streets were enough for that awkwardness to disappear. On my first trail ride, the bar already felt natural. Climbing felt amazing and descending was all smiles. After three rides I knew that I've entered a new handlebar chapter. 45° is where it's at. 45° is the number that'll define every cockpit of any future mountain bike I may build. Back sweeps lower than 20 degrees? Ancient history!</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 27, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://collideous.github.io/tags/bike-components/">bike components</a></li><li><a href="https://collideous.github.io/tags/handlebars/">handlebars</a></li><li><a href="https://collideous.github.io/tags/tales-of-a-successful-experiment/">tales of a successful experiment</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://collideous.github.io/media/website/profile.picture.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Patrick Strahm"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://collideous.github.io/authors/patrick-strahm/" class="invert" rel="author">Patrick Strahm</a></h3><p>Mountains are not stadiums where I satisfy my ambition to achieve, they are the cathedrals where I practice my religion.</p></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://collideous.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://collideous.github.io/40-is-the-new-28/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> 40 Is The New 28</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://collideous.github.io/a-look-back-at-some-home-brew-hubs/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> A Look Back At Some Home-Brew Hubs </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://collideous.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-11-09T18:29" class="feed__date">November 9, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://collideous.github.io/making-tools-for-a-bearing-swap/" class="invert">Making Tools For A Bearing Swap</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-12-19T19:02" class="feed__date">December 19, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://collideous.github.io/custom-carbon-front-light-mount/" class="invert">Custom Carbon Front Light Mount</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2018-11-05T20:19" class="feed__date">November 5, 2018</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://collideous.github.io/a-look-back-at-some-home-brew-hubs/" class="invert">A Look Back At Some Home-Brew Hubs</a></h3></article></div></div><div class="post__comments"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5">Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
