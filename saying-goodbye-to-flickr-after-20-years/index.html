back, I ditched the few social media apps I had been using.  I had never been the doomscroller. Facebook and Instagram were places to visit when the feeds showed posts in chronological order from the people I was following. Once algorithms fed me a constant flow of garbage, I started hating these apps. Interestingly, for instance, Instagram's mobile app was far worse than its web app. Since most users visit these platforms on mobile devices, that's where most advertising dollars are going. None of these platforms have anything worthwhile to see these days. I banned them from my phone, and I don't miss them a bit.</p><p>Shortly after wiping them off my phone, I also deleted the two news apps I was using – Google News and Feedly. They were useful, but if I can read the news when I'm sitting at a computer, why waste time doing the same on the phone? This reduced my daily iPhone screen time to about 20 minutes. Something funny happens when you only look at your phone for 15 to 20 minutes a day. You no longer feel the need to buy a new phone. My small iPhone 12 Mini is perfect for the handful of things I use it for. It'll only be replaced once it can no longer run the latest iOS.</p><p>The app and service cleanse continued. I sunsetted my Flickr account. I joined in 2006 – a whopping 20 years ago – and uploaded 10,509 photos. Flickr used to be a pretty vibrant community, but like all other social media, user activity has largely disappeared. I'm as guilty as anyone. I don't check what anyone else is uploading. Until 2018, a Pro account cost $24.95 and has climbed to $79.99 annually for the past four years. It will be $89.00 in 2026. Add subscriptions to Strava, iCloud, Netflix, Office 365, etc., and a chunk of hard-earned cash is missing from your checking account. The closer I get to retirement, the more I want to cut such monthly expenses. Landline, cable TV, and car ownership could one day end up on the same chopping block.</p><p>I didn't delete my Flickr account in one go. First, I cancelled my Pro subscription. When you do that, Flickr offers you a lower subscription. I declined the offer. My Pro subscription was paid for until June 2026, and I could have kept my account until then. I have all those photos in Apple Photos and backed up in iCloud. It was time to pull them from public view.  Deleting my account was shockingly easy – a few clicks and it was gone, no confirmation email whatsoever. It is my goal to leave no traces online and to wipe all the data I've left here and there, including this website. Two web profiles remain for now – LinkedIn and Strava.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on November 14, 2025</p><div class="content__actions"><ul class="content__tag"><li><a href="https://offtrail.guru/tags/blog-post/">blog post</a></li><li><a href="https://offtrail.guru/tags/miscellaneous/">miscellaneous</a></li></ul><div class="content__share"><button class="btn--icon content__share-button js-content__share-button"><svg width="20" height="20" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://offtrail.guru/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#share"></use></svg> <span>Share It</span></button><div class="content__share-popup js-content__share-popup"></div></div></div><div class="content__bio bio"><img src="https://offtrail.guru/media/website/profile.picture.jpg" loading="lazy" height="1080" width="1080" class="bio__avatar" alt=""><div><h3 class="h4 bio__name"><a href="https://offtrail.guru/authors/patrick/" rel="author">Patrick</a></h3><div class="bio__desc"><p>Happy average human, solo cyclist, purlieu explorer, and expert backyard traveler.</p></div></div></div></div><nav class="content__nav"><div class="wrapper"><div class="content__nav-inner"><div class="content__nav-prev"><a href="https://offtrail.guru/new-lights-for-the-upcoming-dark-days/" class="content__nav-link" rel="prev"><figure class="content__nav-image"><img src="https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/113/responsive/lights-2025-00-xs.webp" class="lazyload" loading="lazy" alt="The Hori 1300 on my Marin Gestalt X12G." height="1988" width="1988"></figure><div><span>Previous</span> New Lights For The Upcoming Dark Days</div></a></div></div></div></nav></footer></article><div class="content__comments"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="comments"><div class="comments-wrapper"><h2>Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><noscript>Please enable JS to use the comments form.</noscript><script type="text/javascript">var disqus_config = function () {

I hit the sack between 10 and 11 PM to be woken up by my wife between 3 and 4 AM. She goes to bed, and I go upstairs, clean our cats’ litter box, feed them, and get some more sleep on the couch with the alarm clock set to wake me up at regular intervals to feed our kitties. Most of the time, I get up after 8 AM to make breakfast for myself and our cats. Since my wife is getting a few hours of rest in our downstairs bedroom, I spend the morning with quiet activities. Lately, this has been setting up my MacBook. There’s not a lot of software I need; Edge to browse, Spark to read mail, Photos for my large photo library, Atom, and Publii to maintain this blog, Office 365 and OneDrive, music players such as Sonos, Spotify, and IINA to listen to music. I have to say, macOS Monterey is a wonderful OS.</p><a href="https://offtrail.guru/late-afternoon-fat-biking/" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article><article class="feed__item feed__item--centered"><figure class="feed__image related__image"><img src="https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/28/road-handlebar-evolution.jpg" srcset="https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/28/responsive/road-handlebar-evolution-xs.webp 640w, https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/28/responsive/road-handlebar-evolution-sm.webp 768w, https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/28/responsive/road-handlebar-evolution-md.webp 1024w" sizes="(min-width: 600px) calc(4.38vw + 143px), 87.86vw" loading="lazy" height="2160" width="3840" alt="Descending the Montagne de Romont on March 29, 2019."></figure><div class="feed__content"><header><div class="feed__meta"><img src="https://offtrail.guru/media/website/profile.picture.jpg" loading="lazy" height="1080" width="1080" class="feed__author-thumb" alt=""> <a href="https://offtrail.guru/authors/patrick/" class="feed__author">Patrick</a> <time datetime="2020-10-19T18:53" class="feed__date">October 19, 2020</time></div><h3 class="feed__title"><a href="https://offtrail.guru/my-road-handlebars-over-28-years/">My Road Handlebars Over 28 Years</a></h3></header><p class="dropcap">Looking at the photos of all my road bikes since 1992, one very noticeable change is the handlebar, and in particular, the position of the hoods. On my early bikes, the hoods were extremely low on the bars. Thinking about wrist and arm alignment, particularly in that photo of my black Trek 5200, I wonder how it could have been comfortable. Well, I was a lot younger and rode just fine with that setup. The last couple of years, I’ve standardized my handlebar on all my drop bar bikes, and used a 44 cm wide Thomson KFC-One carbon handlebar. Before that, I ran 42 cm and even narrow 40 cm bars.</p><a href="https://offtrail.guru/my-road-handlebars-over-28-years/" class="readmore feed__readmore">Continue reading...</a></div></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer footer--glued"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>This website is for <a href="https://offtrail.guru/robots.txt" title="No trespassing for LLMs">humans</a>.</p></div><button id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://offtrail.guru/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://offtrail.guru/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
