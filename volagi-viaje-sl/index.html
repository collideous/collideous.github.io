The plan was to buy components little by little to have it completed by year's end. Having slowly but constantly moved to larger and larger tires (check <a href="https://collideous.github.io/40-is-the-new-28/">40 Is The New 28</a>), I wanted to go one step wider yet. So the SL received 650Bx47 WTB Horizon tires. Clearance inside the rear triangle is plenty, which is amazing for a bike that was originally <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/874048428/the-viaje-bicycle-engineered-for-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">designed in 2012</a>. Clearance inside the fork however is a little tight. I have a pair of Compass 650Bx42 Babyshoe Pass which will widen that clearance, though so far I stayed with the Horizons.<br><br>Components were chosen by what I know and trust as well as to standardize them a little. My Ritte Snob Disc underwent an update in 2020 and the Nordest Albarda was built with a very similar set of parts. Using the same brake and drivetrain parts across three bikes just makes upkeep and maintenance easier. <br><br>Somehow Volagi managed to screw up the rear caliper mount on two of three frames. On my black CX the SRAM Force CX1 caliper sat too low causing the rotor to rub. While the creme/black SL is overall the cleanest welded one of the three, the caliper mount was off as well. I had to add 1mm spacers below the caliper to give the rotor enough clearance. I found some nicely machined titanium washers with just the right diameter and thickness to make the correction, though. An easy, clean fix.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 20, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://collideous.github.io/tags/allroad-cycling/">allroad cycling</a></li><li><a href="https://collideous.github.io/tags/bike/">bike</a></li><li><a href="https://collideous.github.io/tags/cycling/">cycling</a></li><li><a href="https://collideous.github.io/tags/road-bikes/">road bikes</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://collideous.github.io/media/website/profile.picture.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Patrick Strahm"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://collideous.github.io/authors/patrick-strahm/" class="invert" rel="author">Patrick Strahm</a></h3><p>Mountains are not stadiums where I satisfy my ambition to achieve, they are the cathedrals where I practice my religion.</p></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://collideous.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://collideous.github.io/my-road-handlebars-over-28-years/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> My Road Handlebars Over 28 Years</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__comments"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5">Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
