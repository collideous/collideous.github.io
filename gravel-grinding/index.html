This bike got ridden until the end of July 2018.</p><p>Kinda funny actually, 2018 was the year where gravel grinding finally made it to Europe and every brand put at least one into their bike lineup and I got out of it. It's a great category of bikes, no doubt about that. In fact, I believe that many Swiss mountain bikers would better be served with a gravel bike rather than the MTBs they sit on, often with suspension front and back. While I enjoyed going hard and fast across the many gravel roads my region has to offer, I took gravel grinding out of my arsenal for mainly one reason.<br><br>Compiling my riding statistics since 2012 to date, the number of times I ride on the road has remained fairly constant over the last couple of years. The number of fat-bike rides has been going up every year (34% of my rides last year). Gravel riding and mountain biking are the two activities that directly competed against each other. Whenever I spent a lot of time on gravel, my trail riding hours suffered and conversely in the years my 29er saw a lot of single-track my gravel bike kept seeing the walls of our basement. Hence the decision to drop gravel grinding. I may come back to it someday and maybe not.<br><br>The 7 years on gravel have had a huge effect, though. Whereas my road bikes of days past had 25mm wide tires, my current road bike now sports 40mm wide rubber. So, whenever the pavement of a small mountain road vanishes, the bike doesn't have to be turned around. Gravel grinding has in that sense led me to <a href="https://collideous.github.io/collideous.github.io/tags/allroad-cycling/">allroad</a> – basically the same bike with the same volume tires, just the knobs are gone.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 27, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://collideous.github.io/collideous.github.io/tags/cycling/">cycling</a></li><li><a href="https://collideous.github.io/collideous.github.io/tags/gravel-grinding/">gravel grinding</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://collideous.github.io/collideous.github.io/media/website/profile.picture.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Patrick Strahm"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://collideous.github.io/collideous.github.io/authors/patrick-strahm/" class="invert" rel="author">Patrick Strahm</a></h3><p>Mountains are not stadiums where I satisfy my ambition to achieve, they are the cathedrals where I practice my religion.</p></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://collideous.github.io/collideous.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://collideous.github.io/collideous.github.io/allroad-cycling/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> AllRoad Cycling</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://collideous.github.io/collideous.github.io/oval-rounds-your-pedal-stroke/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Oval Rounds Your Pedal Stroke </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://collideous.github.io/collideous.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__social"><a href="https://www.instagram.com/patrickstrahm/" aria-label="Instagram"><svg><use xlink:href="https://collideous.github.io/collideous.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#instagram"/></svg></a></div><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii Static CMS</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://collideous.github.io/collideous.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
