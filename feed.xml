                    <p class="dropcap">Whenever you switch a part on your bike, it’s important to do your homework. A coworker of mine once wanted to change the stem on his bike. He got one, went on the put it on the bike, only to realize that his handlebar wouldn’t fit. He had purchased a stem with a 31.8mm clamp. Unfortunately, his bike was equipped with a 35mm handlebar. It’d be easy to laugh and say what a noob. But we can’t all be experts in everything. I’m certainly not. After several winters of riding <a href="https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/">my fat bike</a>, the axle of my crankset has worn where the bearings are seated. Without tightening the pre-load adjuster, there was noticeable play. A tightened pre-load adjuster doesn’t remove that play; it only hides it while the bike is in the work stand. The play is still there under every pedal stroke and will only worsen over time. It will also lead to premature bottom bracket failure. It was therefore time to replace the axle. Because I chose a <a href="https://www.sram.com/en/sram/models/fc-xx-1-c1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SRAM XX1 carbon crankset</a> at the time, a simple axle change isn’t possible. The axle and the non-drive side crank arm form an inseparable unit.</p>

The axle and the non-drive side crank arm form an inseparable unit.</p>

<p>So, I started to look for a new set of cranks. I would have loved to purchase a bling set of cranks with gold anodization. Leonardi offers their <a href="https://www.leonardiracing.com/en/crankset/11-5-capo-gold.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capo cranks</a> like that. Ignite Components has the <a href="https://www.ignitecomponents.com/product-page/catalyst-fatbike-cranks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catalyst fat-bike cranks</a> that can be made in any color. Leonardi doesn’t currently offer fat-bike axles for their Capo cranks and Ignite only offers one Q-factor that is too narrow for my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/">Snakedriver</a>. So, I had to keep doing more homework. Homework is necessary for any crankset purchase no matter the type of bike. There are axle diameters, axle lengths, chain lines, Q-factor, and chain stay clearances to consider.</p>

<p>I immediately started looking at Race Face. Their Cinch-type cranksets come in a lot of flavors, and there’s a wide range of axles available. First, I looked if all the numbers would match up for the <a href="https://www.raceface.com/collections/cranks/products/next-sl-crankset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next SL</a> carbon cranks. But they didn’t. The numbers would have lined up for Race Face’s other carbon crank, the <a href="https://www.raceface.com/collections/cranks/products/next-r-crankset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next R</a>. But this crank was a little busy on the logos. I never cared for the huge “XX” on my old SRAM cranks. I wanted something with no or at least small logos. It just happened that Race Face released a new <a href="https://www.raceface.com/collections/cranks/products/turbine-crankset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turbine</a> aluminum crankset in a modern remake of the legendary Turbine LP cranks (photos below). I studied the <a href="https://r2-bike.com/docs/race_face/turbine_2022_spezifikationen.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drawing</a>, punched the numbers, and came to the conclusion that this was the perfect one. The Q-factor of 208mm with an RF169 spindle is 5mm wider than SRAM’s XX1 Eagle DUB SL crankset. The SRAM cranks were a little tight on my frame and only left 2-3mm clearance to the chain stays. 2.8mm more clearance felt right. The RF169 spindle is for fat bikes with 4” tires and a 170/177 rear axle. My <a href="https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/">Snakedriver</a>, however, runs 4.5” tires and is equipped with a 197mm wide rear hub. To get the chain line right, a Boost chainring with a 3-4mm offset needs to be flipped. The Cinch system, thankfully, lets you do that.</p>

<p>Speaking of flipping a Boost chainring, when it is oval, it’s also necessary to rotate it once flipped. I took a piece of paper, installed the chainring the way it is intended, drew the outline of the ring onto the paper, marked the direction of the crank, then flipped the ring and rotated it until it matched the outline on the paper. Lastly, it came to figuring out the right axle spacers and mounting them. Fortunately, I had plenty of 30mm axle spacers at various widths. I also had two different <a href="https://chrisking.com/products/threadfit-30-bottom-bracket-fit-kits" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris King BB fits kits</a> on hand. First, I popped in the plastic BB sleeves with the thicker shoulder and used a 6mm spacer on the drive side. This would have worked, although the drive-side crank was a little closer to the chain stay than the crank on the non-drive side. So, I exchanged the BB sleeves for the ones with the thin shoulder and corrected with a wider spacer. This equalized the clearance between the cranks and the chain stays. Lastly, I needed to find the right spacer to fill the gap on the non-drive side. A 2.5mm wide spacer did just that.</p>

<p>With an all-new drivetrain, the <a href="https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/">Snakedriver</a> is ready for winter if winter will show up. There are two more updates scheduled already. First, a <a href="https://bikerumor.com/prologo-adds-performance-xc-womens-and-ultralight-emtb-saddles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prologo Scratch NDR</a> saddle once it hits the store shelves. And secondly, a user-serviceable dropper post to replace the <a href="https://www.bikethomson.com/product/covert-dropper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomson Covert</a> seat post. The <a href="https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/products/resolve-dropper-post" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolf Tooth Resolve</a> dropper post may be a contender.</p>

                    <p class="dropcap">When I first started fat-biking in March of 2013, I grabbed one of my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/51023147937" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giro Aeon</a> road/MTB helmets and slipped on a winter cycling cap when my head felt too cold.

Soon, it became the helmet I wore for fat-biking exclusively. For very cold or snowy days, I bought a Smith Vantage, a goggle-friendly ski helmet with ear pads and adjustable vents. The Brentwood is now ten years old. Safe for the visor, which forms one piece with the liner, it held up amazingly well. But after ten years, even a sturdy helmet such as the Brentwood should be replaced.</p>

<p>With a <a href="https://www.smithoptics.com/en_US/p/helmet/forefront-2-mtb-helmet/FOREFRONT2-HELMET.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smith Forefront 2</a> for sunny winter days and a <a href="https://www.smithoptics.com/en_US/p/helmet/vantage-mens-snow-helmet/VANTAGE-HELMET.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smith Vantage</a> for freezing and windy conditions, I needed a good helmet for weather conditions in between. The Bern Brentwood fit right in there, although it wasn’t perfect. At the top, it had six openings that were entry points for snow on days with heavy snowfall. While I still wanted a helmet with vents, the ideal helmet would have none on top. I found just that with <a href="https://www.kask.com/en-us/cycling/moebius_24_97.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kask’s Moebius</a> urban helmet. Another interesting helmet in the same category is the <a href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en/tone/p/220797" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Specialized Tone</a>. I went with the Moebius because of its detachable visor and because it covers the back of one’s head more than the Tone. As far as design, the Specialized Tone certainly looks sleeker. In the case of the two, I picked function over form. Let’s not forget that my use case isn’t what the designers of those helmets had in mind when they drafted them on the drawing boards. Well, winter can come as far as I’m concerned.</p>

<p>I graduated from college during the economic recession in the early 1990s. Before the recession hit, recruiters were filling the main hall of our college at the end of the school year. When our class graduated, recruiters were nowhere to be seen. Companies were firing people and not looking for new graduates. I had a shiny new diploma in mechanical engineering, but the industry had no job for me. So, in 1993 I decided to spend the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72177720302209274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">summer</a> working as a mountain bike guide for <a href="https://www.eurotrek.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurotrek</a>. They offered a one-week bike trip through the Swiss Jura and needed a guide for the season.</p>

<p>In 1994 I found some temporary employment in the medical industry. It was my first design job creating tools and medical implants in Unigraphics for one of the largest medical implant manufacturers at the time. It was a summer job while regular employees were on vacation. There was lots of work to get done, so they hired temps like me. The job was half across the country, and the company paid for lodging as well as meals. It was a pretty good salary, too. But as it was only for a few months, I decided to invest the money I had earned to improve my language skills and left for a 9-month language course in Oakland, California. Oakland? EF, who ran the language program, had many other locations in the US. To learn English best, I didn't want to be in a school with a bunch of other Swiss students. And Oakland wasn't a popular destination. At the time, most of them headed to Santa Barbara or San Diego. So I went to Oakland, where only four other Swiss students had enrolled in the extensive language program being offered by EF on the campus of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/sets/72177720302201485/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mills College</a>.</p>

<p>It’s kind of interesting to look back at such moments in life. I met a girl that year, and her mom met a Swiss national who owned a <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-Contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business</a> in Northern California while she was selling books at a flea market in Sebastopol. He was looking for a Swiss engineer who would act as a liaison with the teams at the Swiss headquarters. I took the job, moved to Northern California for ten years, got married inbetween, and returned to Switzerland. Had I gone somewhere else, I would have met other people, and life would have turned out very differently. Maybe I would have never moved to the United States, maybe I would still be there, or maybe I’d be living somewhere else entirely. Spending hours scanning those old photos had me reflect on all that. Life is full of crossroads, and a different life awaits in every direction. Crossroads of life have one thing not in common with physical intersections; they don’t carry street signs. Left, right, straight ahead - all would lead onto a whole different path. Better or worse? We, fortunately, will never know.</p>

<p>Anyway, as a cyclist, it was no question that I would bring <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/52368731834" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my bike</a> along. I could have bought one over there, but I had a tight budget, and my savings needed to last ten months. I was busy traveling around the state with classmates most of the time. When spring break came along, my friends couldn’t decide what they wanted to do. I tossed my bike into the trunk of my car and took off for Moab, Utah, where I spent the week riding daily. I had bought a used <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/52368782513" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plymouth Gran Fury</a> for about $4000, and a mountain bike easily fit into the massive trunk. When I was done with a ride, I hiked Arches National park in the afternoons. Returning to school with <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/sets/72177720302212137/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photos</a> of riding and hiking around Moab convinced a close friend of mine to head out there with me one more time. During our visit to Moab, we booked a guided bike week with <a href="https://westernspirit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Western Spirt Cycling</a> through the Maze District of the Canyonlands National Park. In June of 1995, I returned to the region for a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/sets/72177720302224338/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">third time</a> while visiting many of Utah's breathtaking national parks.</p>

                    <p class="dropcap">Most of my cycling photos taken during the past six years have been shot with a GoPro Hero 5 Session in video mode. When I want to snap a picture of myself riding a particular spot on a trail or capture the scenery along a particular route, I place the <a href="https://gopro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoPro</a> on the ground, press the record button, hop on the bike, ride away from the camera, turn around and ride back towards the camera. I have an extendable mini-tripod that is small enough to fit into a jersey pocket and a longer one that needs to go into a backpack or a jersey pocket if I wear a vest over it. Shooting that way takes all but a few minutes, and the video footage the GoPro recorded is often not more than a minute and a half. At home, I view the video footage on my MacBook Pro in <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VLC</a> and export the snapshots I want. Then, those unedited snapshots are imported into <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photos</a>, where I crop and color-adjust them.</p>

<p>The GoPro Hero 5 Session has been the perfect tool for it. I bought a <a href="https://www.dji.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DJI</a> Osmo Pocket in 2019, and while it’s a nice piece of equipment, it didn’t replace the small, cubic GoPro. By action camera standards, the Hero 5 Session is ancient now, and I’ve kept an eye on the market for a replacement that does the job better while remaining as small in size. In November 2021, DJI released just such a compact camera, the <a href="https://www.dji.com/ch/dji-action-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Action 2</a> camera. It’s a magnetic action camera consisting of a camera unit with either a front touchscreen or a power module. As always, with equipment like this, I’m never first in line to buy it. I wait for reviews to come in and then wait some more until demand drops and the manufacturer decides to drop the price. Swiss comparison website <a href="https://www.toppreise.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toppreise.ch</a> has a nifty price monitoring tool that can send you an alert if the price drops below a value you set. In early July, I got such an alert because DJI dropped the price to its lowest price yet. So, I pulled the trigger on the Power Combo for CHF 289.00, shipping included.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy"  src="https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/64/dji.action2.power.combo.png" alt="Price development of the DJI Action 2 Power Combo." width="971" height="549" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/64/responsive/dji.action2.power.combo-xs.webp 300w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/64/responsive/dji.action2.power.combo-sm.webp 480w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/64/responsive/dji.action2.power.combo-md.webp 768w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/64/responsive/dji.action2.power.combo-lg.webp 1024w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/64/responsive/dji.action2.power.combo-xl.webp 1360w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/64/responsive/dji.action2.power.combo-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Action cameras by GoPro, DJI, <a href="https://www.insta360.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insta360</a>, or others are designed as portable POV cameras to capture your adventures on a bike, on skis, in a kayak, or any other outdoor sport. But let's be honest, if you're not a paid madman jumping across canyons at <a href="https://www.redbull.com/int-en/events/rampage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redbull Rampage</a> and video-editing isn’t a talent of yours, most POV videos won’t generate much more than a yawn if anyone spares a few minutes to watch them. When I had my first few action cameras, I stitched together a dozen Youtube videos. A handful garnered a respectable number of views, but most did not. To produce anything worth watching, one has to spend a big chunk of time filming and an even bigger chunk of time editing. Since I neither have the time nor the drive to spend hours on video production, I've used my action cameras almost solely to capture myself riding short trail segments and extracting the best photo from the short video clips. It is something that doesn’t require a lot of time, either during the ride or afterward on the computer at home. Okay, an action cam use case may be to create short video clips for <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reels</a>, but I'm honestly too old for that.</p>

<p>It left a grin on my face for the rest of an extremely tough climb. A real bike. So, in the eyes of that hiker, an eBike isn’t a real bike. It still has me thinking. Much may have to do with the fact that a human-powered mountain biker isn’t much faster than a hiker when a trail points upwards. An eBiker, by contrast, flies by with a greatly elevated speed. I don’t know what is going on here. I only observe that hikers have become much friendlier to a human-powered biker like myself ever since they have to share the trails with motorized bikes.</p>

<p><a href="https://offtrail.guru">Offtrail.guru</a> isn’t getting updated as frequently as I would like to, but sometimes there are other priorities in life. That’s just how it is. If I have more time to ride, shoot photos, and share them here, I’d like to bring a drone along on my cycling adventures again. I got my feet wet with <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/tags/drone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one</a> in 2017. In those five years, drones have become a whole lot better and a whole lot more reliable. But as long as I can’t dedicate any time to such a high-tech toy, I’ll keep following the drone market without actually pulling out my wallet to get one.</p>

                    <p class="dropcap">Cycling hasn’t been the same for me for the last three years. From 2016 through 2018, I used to ride over <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/embed/u/0/reporting/60bb91ce-3be9-4296-badb-cd114501fac7/page/p_43xyf0plrc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">8’000 kilometers</a>. When we <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/49233350262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">moved</a> in 2019, my mileage dropped considerably before, during, and after the move. In 2020, and 2021, my riding dropped even further. Not because of the pandemic, but because one of our kitties was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. Her sister’s kidneys were in slightly better shape. This dramatically changed our lives. From then on, at least one of us had to be home. Taking care of our cats to provide them with the best possible quality of life became a 24/7 job. My wife usually worked the late-night shift, and we would switch around 3-4 AM. Our palliative care included feeding both kitties every two hours or more frequently if they didn’t eat well enough. Cats with chronic kidney disease lose appetite. The sicker of the two, <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/tags/chicchic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chic Chic</a>, was also given sub-Qs by us once a week. Besides both of us working full-time jobs, such care-taking left both of us often exhausted. I tried to maintain a regular riding schedule but rode locally and much shorter. In 2020, I managed to ride over 5’200, mostly road kilometers. In 2021, that dropped to 4’200 km. Our Chic Chic was a brave cookie. She got weaker, but she was happy that we were taking care of her. She far outlived our vet’s prognosis but sadly had to be euthanized in the afternoon of Friday, March 11th. She had been with us for 17 years. Palliative care now continues for her smaller sister, Chou Chou. She is still stronger than her sister was, but she may not be the fighter that her sister was.</p>

<p>On March 5th, I began riding my new <a href="https://offtrail.guru/stooge-mk5/">Stooge MK5</a> on weekends. The trailhead is just two minutes from home. I’ve been heading westwards from Grenchen because time is still limited, and the trails out west are the ones I know. At first, steering was a little awkward with the MK5. The super-wide <a href="https://offtrail.guru/another-cockpit-change/">Ritchey Comp Kyote</a> handlebar, and the lively nature of the MK5, made keeping a straight line in a steep uphill quite challenging. But this may have also had a lot to do with the fact that I haven’t been on a mountain bike in a while. With every additional ride under the belt, the bike has started to feel more familiar. The struggle to keep a straight line also has vanished. It’s starting to feel like a really great bike. On the flats, down hills, on technical or flowy trails, the MK5 is a really fun bike. I also love having more rubber. While I have spent the majority of my mountain biking career, if one can call it that, on 1.95-2.4” tires, I prefer more rubber these days. A 3.0” tire isn’t quite a fat-bike tire. It doesn’t come with the humongous air volume and is, therefore, a bit harsher, but it has a similar grip in dry conditions. Overall, it’s a really fun bike to ride.</p>

<p>I nailed the setup, too. There’s nothing that needs changing. My <a href="https://offtrail.guru/the-nuts-and-bolts-of-bb3106/">BB3106</a> setscrew bottom bracket is silent. I was worried about that because setscrew EBBs can be troublesome. There’s one thing creaking, and that’s the seat post. I used Motorex friction grease on it, and it only managed to silence the post for a few hours of riding. Next, I applied the oil that protects the inside of the steel tubes from rusting. This killed the creaking but made the seat post slip. I’m going to test grease, and if slippage still occurs, I’m going to test regular carbon friction paste. I may at some point in the future purchase a wireless Reverb AXS dropper post. For super technical trails, a dropper can be the difference between walking or riding the trail.</p>

                    <p class="dropcap">I bought my first 29er in 2006 when most were still riding 26-inch wheels and stuck with that wheel size for all things mountain biking, which in my world was rigid and single-speed. After we moved into a region where most of the trails are too steep for a bike without a derailleur, I had to consider adding a geared MTB to my bike fleet. At the time, the knobby side of the fleet consisted of my 29er <a href="https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-marauder/">44 Marauder</a>, the 26" 44 Big Boy, and the 27.5" <a href="https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/">44 Snakedriver</a> fat-bikes. I did a bit of reconnaissance on the old <a href="https://offtrail.guru/old-mountain-bikes/">Big Boy</a> and quickly realized that the new trails I loved required more traction than a regular 2.2-2.4" tire can put on the ground. The Big Boy with its tractor-sized tires climbed wonderfully, but the snow-only I9 wheels were too delicate for the rocky descents, and the bike, in general, was more at home on gentler terrain.</p>

<p>I considered a trail fatty such as a purple <a href="https://intl.bikes.com/collections/blizzard/products/blizzard-c50-22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rocky Mountain Blizzard 50</a>, a <a href="https://www.norco.com/bike-archives/2020/bigfoot-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Norco Bigfoot</a>, or a <a href="https://www.giant-bicycles.com/us/yukon-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giant Yukon 1</a>. But then Andy Stevenson designed the <a href="http://stoogecycles.co.uk/product/mk5-18-swamp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stooge MK5</a> around 27.5+ tires. Although this tire size reached its apotheosis in 2015 and 2016 and has all but died, I think 27.5 plus tires still have their merits. Cycling is a fashion industry, and currently, 29-inch wheels are fashionable. I remember the days when many called them a fad. For a long time, the downhill-oriented crowd within the mountain bike community never wanted to touch these big wheels. Now, practically everyone sits on 29" wheels. It's a wheel size that inspires confidence. It rolls over stuff easily. 27.5" is the fun-sized wheel size. I'd say the same for gravel and road, where I find 650B more agile and fun than 700C. In the 27.5x3.0 size, tire diameter is almost identical to a 29x2.2. Choices may make this sport confusing to the beginner trying to find the right bike, but options are awesome for the experienced rider who can build the perfect bike to match his skills and his playground.</p>

<p>I have designed and manufactured <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157623712420608" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hubs</a> and mountain bike <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/51729048713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brakes</a> for myself and occasionally made other <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/4979701966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">small bits</a> for my bikes. Unless you have the space and the disposable income to set up your own small workshop equipped with a lathe and a mill, preferably CNC, making parts like my BB3106 is sadly out of reach for most, even if you have the professional background like myself to design them. If you don't own the necessary machines, you can only get something like this made if you know someone who will do you a favor to do the machining or if you know how to operate the machines, lets you use their shop. It's basically impossible to find a machine shop that will take the time to machine a single workpiece or even a few. And if a shop would do it, you would probably immediately drop the idea as soon as you'd see the quote. Your jaw will probably drop looking at the price table below.</p>
<p>While I often have ideas swirling around my brain for some clever bicycle component - and I've probably had hundreds in all the years I've been riding - most often, these ideas stay just that, a fun daydream while riding. As a trained machine mechanic and graduate mechanical engineer, I know how to design and make stuff. But because I don't have the machines to make any of it, nor good connections to a CNC shop, I often don't even bother putting any of these ideas on paper. In the case of the BB3106, the guys in our applications department did me a favor and machined the bottom bracket on a CNC lathe in our demo room. They ended up with four scrap parts until the tooling was perfectly dialed to machine three good bottom brackets. All in all, it was a full day's work. A CNC shop generally has various chucks they can put on a lathe and has drawers full of turning tools. They won’t have a day, but they will still have a considerable setup time. If you had to pay real-world shop hours, you wouldn't be able to afford such a bottom bracket. That's why it's extremely rare for me to undertake such a project. Let's go through the nuts and bolts of the project:</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Design</span><br>The function the item has to perform dictates the design. So do the elements that mate with the BB. The frame has a 54.7mm ID bottom bracket shell with a width of 73mm. The axle I'm using is a 30mm <a href="https://rotorbike.com/catalog/default/kapic-axle.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotor Boost axle</a>. So, there's that. The rest is dictated by the bearings I'm using and by the chain line.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Materials</span><br>The BB3106 is machined out of <a href="https://www.impol.com/app/uploads/2020/07/Aluminium-alloy-EN-AW-6026.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EN AW-6026</a> aluminum, an alloy renowned for good machining characteristics and excellent anodizing response. I bought <a href="https://www.enduroforkseals.com/products/wheels-and-brakes/wheel-bearings-individual/angular-contact-cartridge/440c_abec5_ac/S71806-LLB.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Enduro S71806 440C</a> stainless angular contact bearings and two <a href="https://www.bike24.com/p2283482.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SKF 61806 2RS1 MTRX10</a> solid oil bearings. Two bearing seals provide extra protection. To clamp the BB, I use stainless flat-faced ball-ended setscrews and a pair of replaceable brass shims so that the setscrews can't gouge the BB3106.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Machining</span><br>I work for a <a href="https://www.wenk-ag.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">company</a> that sells CNC machines. We always have a few in our demo room. While I used to use CNC machines during my apprenticeship more than 30 years ago, I haven't been trained to operate the modern machines we sell. It's just not part of my job. Our applications guys made the part for me on one of the CNC lathes in our exposition room. It was quite a challenge as our tooling selection is limited and we only have the standard factory-equipped chucks, but they got it done.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Anodizing</span><br>I'm lucky to live in a highly industrial area, where surface finishing companies are plentiful. I don't even have to leave town to have something <a href="http://www.swiss-pvd-coating.ch/en/coatings/tin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">titanium-nitride coated</a> or to get something <a href="https://www.ghg.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anodized</a>. With small quantities, such as my bottom bracket or the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/44767756895" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">head badge</a> for my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/">Snakedriver</a>, you just have to be patient until the surface finisher has some larger job, where they can add your parts.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Assembly</span><br>The assembly of the BB3106 is the last and easiest step; press one bearing in on one side, then do the same with the other. A bit of grease helps the process. Lightly grease the Boost axle and push it through the bearings, not forgetting the outer bearing seal.</li>
<li><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Cost</span><br>The parts and raw materials are easy to calculate. For machining, I paid nothing other than lunch for two applications technicians. If I put the CNC shop hour at CHF 200.00 for such prototype work and they need 6 hours, machining the BB3106 would cost CHF 1'200.00. That's likely not an exaggeration, quite possibly in fact, it's even at the low end of it here in Switzerland.<br>

<p>So, it's easy to see that custom parts, such as this bottom bracket, are out of reach for the casual component designer, who needs a CNC shop to have an idea realized. This BB3106 wouldn't exist if I had to put a 1500 franc hole into my wallet.</p>

                    <p>If there's one thing I would change about the <a href="https://offtrail.guru/stooge-mk5/">Stooge MK5</a>, it's the eccentric bottom bracket. With a 1x12 drivetrain, I simply don't need it. I acknowledge that there are benefits to having one. For one, the MK5 can be set up single-speed or geared. As such, it has a wider appeal, and should I ever part with it, the circle of potential buyers would be considerably larger. My experiences with the two EBB-equipped bikes I've owned, however, were more bad than good. My <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157594265939262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Niner One9</a>, for instance, had a setscrew EBB. The setscrews quickly ate themselves into the EBB, and the BB shell ovalized over time, leaving a wide gap between the shell and the EBB. The gap filled with dirt, and the whole setup was creaking more often than not. My <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157624709981871" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Air9 Carbon</a> came with Niner's own <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/5007770051/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bio-Centric</a> bottom bracket, a design that clamps to the outside faces of the EBB shell. In theory, this seemed great. Machine a precise cylindrical BB shell with parallel outside faces and clamp two eccentric cups against those faces. In practice, it was pretty shitty, to say the least. For one, machining tolerances were such that a Bio-Centric cup would more easily turn on one side of the shell than on the other. But much worse was that Niner designed large cutouts into the shell so that shifter cables could be routed internally. This dramatically weakened the shell to the point that the proper tightening torque of the Bio-Centric was enough to crush it. It was an extremely troublesome design that creaked a lot as well.</p>

<p>So, one could think that I wouldn't touch a bike with an eccentric BB with a ten-foot pole, but when you're looking for a rigid, non-suspension corrected bike, the options are pretty small. And, I love every other aspect of the MK5. Besides, it's steel and should therefore have a much stronger BB shell. The BB shells of the two Niners I owned were both aluminum. The ovalizing seen on the One9 should not happen to a steel shell, IMHO. Since I'm not running this bike single-speed, there's no need for an eccentric BB. So I thought, why not design my own CBB (concentric bottom bracket) and simplify this central part of the bike in the process? The standard setup requires the EBB insert, two setscrews, two external bottom bracket cups, and depending on your crankset axle, various amounts of spacers. Designing my own CBB, I can get rid of the BB cups by using a CBB insert that holds two bearings. Design it to the exact width of the Rotor Boost axle, and I can get rid of the axle spacers, too. To avoid munching up the CBB shell, I'm using two stainless flat-faced ball-ended setscrews, which press onto replaceable brass shims. Being concentric and manufactured to a tighter tolerance, I should also be able to tighten the setscrews with less torque. Riding the hell out of it will tell if the design is any good.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy"  src="https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/bb3106-5.png" alt="BB3016 CAD Drawing." width="1482" height="754" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/responsive/bb3106-5-xs.webp 300w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/responsive/bb3106-5-sm.webp 480w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/responsive/bb3106-5-md.webp 768w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/responsive/bb3106-5-lg.webp 1024w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/responsive/bb3106-5-xl.webp 1360w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/responsive/bb3106-5-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Since the bottom bracket is a design of my own, it doesn't follow any current bike standards. If you will, it's a new standard that I developed specifically for Rotor Kapic cranks with Boost axle mounted to a <a href="http://stoogecycles.co.uk/product/mk5-18-swamp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stooge MK5</a> frame. It will not fit any other cranks. Every new standard needs a designation. CBB30 was a thought. Or referencing axle diameter and BB width, such as BB386 or BB392 do, it could be called BB3106. BB3106, that's right. Remember that you saw it here first!</p>

<p>Yesterday, I decided to visit the Bözingenberg. The northern side of it, as well as the whole valley of Vauffelin, don’t see much sun during these months. The other weekend, when I drove to les Prés d’Orvin, for instance, it was -10ºC in Vauffelin while it was about +1ºC in Prés d’Orvin. Sure enough, I spent the whole way on snow. Crossing the Bözingenberg west to east brought ever-changing snow conditions. South-western facing slopes were often slushy. Flatter, sun-exposed patches often had no or little snow. Eastern facing slopes or wooded areas were all still covered with crunchy snow. Speaking of studs, the last mile to get home I pop onto the Grenchenberg road. Going downhill and entering Grenchen I arrive with quite some speed. Fat-bike tires with huge knobs are loud, to begin with, add metals studs, and you’re likely the loudest vehicle that comes down the hill all day. Not surprisingly, every pedestrian on the sidewalk turns around to see what’s approaching.</p>

<p>In other news, I’m glad to have a MacBook Pro again. The small <a href="https://www.chuwi.com/product/items/Chuwi-LarkBox.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chuwi Larkbox</a> mini PC I bought in the <a href="https://offtrail.guru/finally-a-new-pc-on-my-desk/">fall of 2020</a> has been giving me trouble the past couple of months. When it started, I decided to backup everything to the cloud. I reinstalled Windows a couple of times, which temporarily fixed the problems, but they became more frequent, and now the unit seems toast. Although the Larkbox had a small internal fan, I think heat management may have been the issue that led to its failure. While I now do most things on my MacBook, like typing this post, there are a few things for which software on Windows is easier to find. Since I don’t need a powerful nor expensive PC, I decided to buy a 2.8” mini PC under the name "<a href="https://liliputing.com/2022/01/this-2-8-inch-mini-pc-has-an-intel-celeron-n5105-processor-dual-hdmi-ports.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZX01</a>". This PC is equipped with a much newer generation of processor than the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/128989/intel-celeron-j4105-processor-4m-cache-up-to-2-50-ghz/specifications.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">J4105</a> of the Larkbox, an Intel Celeron <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/212328/intel-celeron-processor-n5105-4m-cache-up-to-2-90-ghz/specifications.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">N5105</a> Jasper Lake. The ZX01 is slightly larger, has two HDMI ports, and hopefully better cooling. It’s somewhat a mystery who the manufacturer behind it is. The ZX01 is primarily sold through <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AliExpress</a>, which I have been using more and more frequently. Need titanium bolts for your bike? Check AliExpress. Need PC accessories or other electronics? Check AliExpress. Often, you find the same things that Swiss vendors sell in their online shops for a third of the price or even less. I’m taking a bit of a risk with a nice-looking mini PC, with good specs but unknown origin. I also bought a 2.5” hard drive enclosure for a few bucks. It’s for an old drive that sits inside of an enclosure with Firewire ports. Remember Firewire? Lastly, I got a small USB enclosure for the M.2 2242 SSD I pulled out of my Chuwi Larkbox. Cost? 12 bucks including shipping.</p>
