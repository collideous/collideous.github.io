                <p class="dropcap">This weekend Europeans turned the clocks back an hour and perhaps for the last time. This would totally suck because I happen to like daylight saving time. If we're not going to change our clocks twice a year, I'd prefer the time to stay on DST all year round. Winston Churchill argued that daylight saving time enlarges "the opportunities for the pursuit of health and happiness among the millions of people‚Äù and I full-heartedly agree. DST is far better for my physical and psychological well-being. My "seven to five" work hours only allow me to be outdoors in the evening and it's a lot nicer and far safer to ride when it's still light outside. It's much harder to find the motivation to head out into the darkness with lights mounted to the bike. I love fat-bike night rides in the snow and occasionally do road rides at night, but having to do it for more than half the year would not be too much fun. Most likely, I'd be exercising far less. Wikipedia mentions several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time#Economic_effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies</a> that conclude that retailers, sporting goods makers, and other businesses benefit from extra afternoon sunlight. I spend a great deal on cycling equipment, clothing, and nutrition. On a wintertime schedule, those spending habits would undoubtedly be considerably smaller. Besides, that extra morning hour in the winter makes no difference. I leave home in the dark, whether the clock would happen to be on summer or wintertime.</p>

<p>For the last ten or so years, I've always been on a Mac Book Pro. I bought one for myself in California in 2008 and afterward always inherited my wife's Mac Book Pro. As a graphic designer, she always got a new system every couple of years. Before that, I worked on Macs at my job and owned Gateway PCs for personal use. These were towers with room for several hard drives, CD-ROM drive, Zip drive, and even a 3 1/2" floppy; monsters that had to be hidden under the desk.</p>
<p>While I still want a Mac Book, the Chuwi Larkox was the ideal unit to be able to do a bit more than on the Raspberry Pi. As often with crowd-funding campaigns, the Larkbox arrived a little behind schedule. It was a month late, so absolutely nothing to be mad about. On September 24th, the unit sat in my mail box. I had upgraded my campaign contribution to get the Larkbox with an additional 240GB M.2 SSD. Windows 10 Home Edition came pre-installed.</p>
<p>I've been using this tiny unit for a month now, and I'm very pleased with it. Chuwi didn't pre-install the latest Windows 10; it was running version 1909 and for a while, Windows Update indicated that the hardware was incompatible for 2004. As various people on the Chuwi forum reported running into problems trying to update, I decided to wait. I ordered a 4 port <a href="https://icybox.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Icy Box</a> USB hub to be able to connect an external hard-drive so that I could do a full system backup. The hub was out of stock and before it shipped, Microsoft released the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-information/status-windows-10-20h2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">20H2 Windows 10 update</a>.</p>
<p>Today, a slim <a href="https://www.lindy.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lindy</a> HDMI cable and the IcyBox USB hub finally arrived allowing me to create a recovery disk and then to go ahead to apply the 20H2 update using Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Update Assistant</a>. Everything went without a single hiccup so I'm able to stay busy on <a href="https://offtrail.guru">offtrail.guru</a>.</p>

No hiccups nor problems, except that the Chris King headset Nordest sold with the frameset isn't suitable for the fork; at least not in my opinion. So a Cane Creek 110 was installed instead. Fork and DT Swiss Centerlock lock ring didn't have enough clearance for me. Then I remembered that my wife's Alfine hub had an older DT Swiss lock ring with an inner spline. This one would leave a wider gap to the fork leg, so I swapped lock rings since it really doesn't matter what type of lock ring is on my wife's bike.</p>

<p>I also needed a new stem. Doing the rough math in my head I figured the stem needed to be slightly shorter with more drop. One weekend morning, I fired up QCAD on my MacBook Pro and drew my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-sl/">Volagi Viaje</a> and my custom-geo Nordest Albarda. A very simplified drawing, because all I needed is a stem length and drop. Whereas my Volagi runs a 110mm stem with -6¬∫, a shorter 100mm stem with -17¬∫ put me into a very similar riding position as the Volagi. So, one was ordered. Zipp, of course, to keep components across my bikes the same. The purpose of the bike is to put me back on 700C wheels so that I can compare them to 650B RoadPlus. With a total weight of 8.6 kg, the Albarda is noticeably lighter than the Volagi. Time will tell if I'll prefer one over the other, and maybe I'll discover that both wheel sizes have their place.</p>

<p>I searched the web for a professional paint repair shop and ended up getting in touch with Stefan at <a href="http://www.cycleworks.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CycleWorks.ch</a>. He was going to give it a shot at repairing the area in question. Once he started working on it, he quickly realized that a quality repair wasn't possible and recommended a full frame repaint. While I liked the original dark blue and clear paint, I used the opportunity to do something else. On March 12th 2019, I built up the bike in its new color and with the SRAM eTap gruppo.<br><br>The bike looked stunning but I somehow had a change of mind and wanted to put a second big tire road bike together for the harsher times of the year. This lead to the <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/">Nordest Albarda</a>. Having decided in the summer to move at the end of the year, finances were tight, so parts came off the Ritte Snob Disc to build the Nordest Albarda. I was going to sell the Ritte and its wheels to put money back into my cycling piggy bank, but held on to it to put it on the market after our move. Once settled into our new home, I changed my mind. The Ritte is just too nice a bike, especially with the new paint, to let it go. In early September the eTap groupset went back from the Albarda to the Ritte and the bike got a new saddle since it needed one.</p>

Loving this bike so much, this was basically the last chance to get my hands on a new Viaje and extend riding one for several more years. In early August this frameset was mine.</p>

<p>Having my red/black RD, I was in no hurry to build it. The plan was to buy components little by little to have it completed by year's end. Having slowly but constantly moved to larger and larger tires (check <a href="https://offtrail.guru/40-is-the-new-28/">40 Is The New 28</a>), I wanted to go one step wider yet. So the SL received 650Bx47 WTB Horizon tires. Clearance inside the rear triangle is plenty, which is amazing for a bike that was originally <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/874048428/the-viaje-bicycle-engineered-for-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">designed in 2012</a>. Clearance inside the fork however is a little tight. I have a pair of Compass 650Bx42 Babyshoe Pass which will widen that clearance, though so far I stayed with the Horizons.<br><br>Components were chosen by what I know and trust as well as to standardize them a little. My <a href="https://offtrail.guru/ritte-snob-disc/">Ritte Snob Disc</a> underwent an update in 2020 and the <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/">Nordest Albarda</a> was built with a very similar set of parts. Using the same brake and drivetrain parts across three bikes just makes upkeep and maintenance easier.¬†<br><br>Somehow Volagi managed to screw up the rear caliper mount on two of three frames. On my black CX the SRAM Force CX1 caliper sat too low causing the rotor to rub. While the creme/black SL is overall the cleanest welded one of the three, the caliper mount was off as well. I had to add 1mm spacers below the caliper to give the rotor enough clearance. I found some nicely machined titanium washers with just the right diameter and thickness to make the correction, though. An easy, clean fix.</p>

On my early bikes the hoods were extremely low on the bars. Thinking about wrist and arm alignment particularly on that photo of my black Trek 5200, I wonder how it could have been comfortable. Well, I was a whole lot younger and rode just fine with that setup.

<figcaption >The evolution of my handlebar setups over the years.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Historically the most frequently used method of determining the handlebar‚Äôs rotation was putting the bottom of the drop parallel to the ground. That‚Äôs how I used to do it on my early road bikes. These days however, I have the upper part of the bar and the hoods as a straight extension parallel or slightly upwards to the ground. The hoods have moved upwards a lot without pointing upwards. They are the place where my hands sit most of the time. I do most of the climbing out of the saddle and when I‚Äôm not in the drops on the flats or while descending, my hands generally grab the hoods. I place my hands on top of the bars only when climbing seated. With age I imagine that my stems are going to grow shorter, they may come up and sit on spacers and the bars will probably rotate upwards further. As always, I‚Äôll let comfort be my guide. For a good guide about the subject check <a href="https://blog.bikefit.com/adjusting-hand-position-in-bike-fitting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Handlebar Adjustments and Hand Position</a> in Bike Fitting.</p>

                <p>I got into cycling with <a href="https://offtrail.guru/old-mountain-bikes/">mountain bikes</a>. After several years of trail riding me and a few friends decided to do some <a href="https://offtrail.guru/tags/road-cycling/">road cycling</a> as well. In 1992 I bought a Trek 5200 from my local bike shop. I rode it through the Jura and through the Seeland a lot, but left it at home during my language year in California in 94/95. It went with me to Sonoma County, when I moved there in 1997. For 4 more years it was the bike I used to climb <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cavedale+Rd,+California,+USA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cavedale Road</a> just outside Sonoma and <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pine+Flat+Rd,+California,+USA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pine Flats</a> after I moved to Santa Rosa. It became my daily commuter after I bought a Litespeed Ultimate until the drive-side chain stay broke in 2006. The bike had a lifetime warranty and Trek USA gave me a Trek Madone 5.2 as a replacement, even though I no longer had the purchase receipt from my Swiss LBS. The Madone 5.2 was built up with the components from the 5200 and took over as my commuter bike; first in Santa Rosa and later in Biel, Switzerland after we moved across the pond. In Switzerland, I upgraded it to a newer Ultegra groupset including Ultegra wheels and sold it in 2010 to make room for another bike. The Litespeed Ultimate was the road bike I owned and rode the longest. It took me across every climb in Sonoma County and climbed across the Chasseral countless times. It served as a single-speed commuter after I built a Neilpryde Alize. In 2014 I bought a fairly inexpensive Volagi Viaje frameset, which forever changed road cycling for me. I went back to what I call a traditional road bike when I built a Ritte Snob Disc. Had I known back then where the Volagi would be taking me, I would have in all likeliness not purchased the Ritte. As gorgeous as this bike is, it was born under a somewhat unlucky star. After two rides, the Enve fork <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/22448281040/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">broke</a>. A few weeks later, Enve actually had to recall that fork. Ritte was great though and sent me a replacement fork in the matching paint. I rode the bike for a couple of years and loved it, but ultimately the Volagi with room for much wider tires took over. When I bought my third Volagi and sold the first one, I decided to move the SRAM eTap HRD groupset from the first Volagi to the Ritte. But before doing so, I wanted a small paint damage on the steerer tube repaired. The fork replacement years earlier came with a lower headset change from 1 1/4" to 1 1/2". Extracting the lower cup and pressing in a new one caused the paint to come off. The paint shop I hired for the repair then realized that a small local paint repair would never be 100%, so we repainted the whole bike. A move in 2019 and the addition of a Nordest Albarda <a href="https://offtrail.guru/allroad-cycling/">allroad</a> bike halted the completion of the Ritte, but finally in 2020 it was carefully put back together. So, there are currently three road bikes in my stable; the Ritte put together with old and new parts, the third Volagi Viaje built with a NOS frameset I had found online in 2018 and an inexpensive Nordest Albarda also built with a mix of old and new parts. Here's the list of the road bikes I've owned over the years.</p>

                <p>I started gravel grinding years before it became a thing in Switzerland. At the time gravel-specific bikes didn‚Äôt really exist so my first two gravel bikes were pure cyclo-cross bikes. I did a bunch of gravel riding for seven years and then moved on in 2018. I can still be found on gravel, but now it‚Äôs generally to get from one paved road to another, which are not otherwise connected. When I was gravel grinding, I always planned my rides to be on gravel <span style="text-decoration: underline;">all</span> the time. Gravel rides did not cut into my road riding, but cut heavily into my mountain biking. The more I spent on gravel, the less I spent on trails. So, I currently no longer own such a bike, although I may get back to it in the future.</p>
<p>Back in 2011 I bought a Focus Mares CX2.0 cross bike to do gravel rides when I didn't feel like mountain biking. A few years later, in October 2014, I replaced it with a Focus Mares CX 0.0. I only kept that bike for a year and bought a second Volagi Viaje the following spring. This one was set up as a gravel bike with a 1x11 drivetrain. Loved it; the stealth black frame, the re-purposed Enve AM 29er/700C wheels and mostly how the bike performed.¬†</p>

                        <img src="https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/24/44-marauder-feature.jpg" alt="Single-speeding in Les Pr√©s d&#x27;Orvin." />
                    <p class="dropcap">In May of 2017 I discovered a fine hairline crack in the seat tube of my Kid Dangerous. The crack started at the hole of the seat tube slot and ran towards the weld of the left side seat stay where it followed the edge of the weld for a little bit. The bike had been ridden 5'500 kilometers on rough Swiss single-track. Kris covered it under his lifetime warranty and began building me a <a href="https://www.44bikes.com/marauder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marauder</a> at the end of the same month. For a one-man shop who has a wait list and basically builds one bike at a time, he certainly made it a mission to get me back on a <a href="https://www.44bikes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FortyFour</a>.</p>
<p>My Kid Dangerous was one of the early client bikes Kris had built and it was an awesome bike. The Marauder got a bit of a longer front triangle and was the first frame Kris built with a T47 bottom bracket shell. I spent a good amount of time online to find a new paint. I loved the flat black on Kid Dangerous, but I sort of make it a habit to never use the same color twice. I wanted to stay with a dark paint and settled with <a href="https://www.prismaticpowders.com/shop/powder-coating-colors/PPS-4005/casper-clear">Casper Clear</a>¬†over¬†<a href="https://www.prismaticpowders.com/shop/powder-coating-colors/PMB-1842/speedway-black">Speedway Black</a>¬†by¬†<a href="https://www.prismaticpowders.com/">Prismatic Powders</a>. There's no bike I could find in this powder coat. It's a finish occasionally used for¬†<a href="https://www.prismaticpowders.com/gallery/5588/speedway-black">custom car rims</a>.</p>
<p>The look of the frame was and is mind-blowing. In the years between the Kid Dangerous was welded and the Marauder was built, Kris has improved his frames in every way. He added new tools to achieve a better build consistency, refined the build process and the time spent welding many frames are clearly visible in each single weld. Kid Dangerous had been an excellent bike. The Marauder is a level better.</p>
<p>Just like all my other mountain bikes, this <a href="https://offtrail.guru/single-speeding/">single-speed</a> was equipped with a Jones H-Bar handlebar. A <a href="https://offtrail.guru/another-cockpit-change/">cockpit change</a> was made in August of 2020. In October 2017 I had to replace the wheels and while doing so, I finally made the jump to tubeless. Yeah, while I was an early adopter of 29ers, early for a Swiss to be <a href="https://offtrail.guru/gravel-grinding/">gravel grinding</a> and early again to <a href="https://offtrail.guru/fat-biking/">fat-bike</a>, I was a total retro grouch when it came to running tubeless tires. Nox Composites Farlow and WTB tires made the switch fairly painless, though.</p>
