There was the plum crazy purple MK1, the redberry MK2, and probably my favorite, the plum crazier purple MK3. The MK1 was specifically designed around a 29×3 front/29×2.3 rear combo, whereas the MK2 received enough clearance on the rear to run 27.5x3" tires. Otherwise, the geometry remained unaltered. A lot of changes were made to the MK3. It had a 44 mm head tube, a tapered steel fork, and a shorter rear triangle. The MK3 was designed around B+ and was up to that point the most agile of the Stooges. With the <a href="http://stoogecycles.co.uk/2019/07/06/lifting-the-lid-on-the-mk4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MK4</a> Andy Stevenson pushed the boundaries and came up with a pretty radical geometry. It had a slack and low geometry and was designed around an 80 mm offset rigid bi-plane fork. It lost the 44 mm headtube and went back to a straight steerer tube. The frame was designed around a 29x3"/2.6" combo but kept room for 27.5x3" in the back. Whether you wanted a single-speed, an all-mountain trail bike, or a bike-packing rig – it did it all.</p>

<p>I would have been stoked to own either an MK3 or an MK4, but they were produced at a time when I didn't actually need such a bike. That has changed in 2021. Last summer I sold my <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157632954649710" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">44 Big Boy</a> fat-bike, which had become my geared trail bike. It was just as a fun bike on dirt as it had been on snow, but after we moved eastwards along the "Jurasüdfuss", it became clear that it wasn't the ideal bike for the trails to the north of our new home. Hence the decision to sell it. It found a new owner in the country it was built and is now <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CLQLVG2A6Zeimm3wTEHhlGASJHCHcj3qmV18So0/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">roaming across trails</a> in the great state of Wisconsin. I kept following what Andy made with Stooge and was excited to read that an MK5 was in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://stoogecycles.co.uk/product/mk5-coming-soon-ish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MK5</a> is a different beast from the MK4. Although Andy has never been a huge fan of boost axles, the market has sort of forced him to adopt the de facto axle standard. The MK5 now has boost spacing front and back. It lost the huge fork offset of the MK4 and now shares the same 57 mm offset bi-plane fork as the previously released Scrambler. Just like the <a href="http://stoogecycles.co.uk/2020/05/30/coming-soon-the-stooge-scrambler/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scrambler</a>, it's equipped with tons of rack and bottle mounting options, so that you can bike-pack this purebred trail-ripper. While you can set it up with 29×3 front/29×2.5-2.6 rear, the MK5 is designed for 27.5x3.0 front and rear, which is exactly the wheel and tire size I wanted to use. Yeah, I know, the trend in mountain biking is currently 29" and tires have come back to sizes in the 2.4 to 2.6 range. 2.8 and 3.0 still exist while 3.25 is almost extinct. Well, I can care less what the current trend is. If I were, I wouldn't be buying a rigid steel bike, now, would I?</p>
<p>I'm also stoked that the MK5 will come in <a href="http://stoogecycles.co.uk/product/mk5-18-brown-pre-order-deposit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">brown</a>, Pantone <a href="https://icolorpalette.com/color/pantone-147-c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">147C</a> to be precise. I've been wanting to own a brown bike forever. If there aren't any unforeseen manufacturing or shipping delays, the ETA should be August 2021. I've got a pretty good idea of how I want to equip the bike, so time has come to place orders to get all the necessary components by the time the frameset arrives. The plan is to strike a good balance between quality and affordability - good parts but within a budget. I have a few bits and pieces already, I've ordered two pairs of 27.5x3.0 tires and need to get hubs and rims next. So, stay tuned for the build progress. Pandemic and all, I'm not setting a timeline on it. It'll be done when it'll be done. I'm lucky to have plenty of other bikes to ride in the meantime. </p>

Such wheels roll well, but they don't like to change direction as quickly as a smaller 650B wheel. I like a bike to be lively and agile. Directional stability can have its advantages, but I generally prefer quick, sharp steering. Switching my Albarda to smaller wheels, instantly gave me that. The bike is so much more fun to ride. Not just when going downhill, but when climbing as well. When riding up a climb out of the saddle, it always seemed like the 700C front wheel was working against me. After putting 650B wheels on the bike, that feeling is gone. The bike now is a better extension of myself when motoring up a climb out of the saddle.</p>

<p>At speed, the wheels and wider tires are an absolute treat. They smooth out everything. Rather than feeling road vibrations, it feels like sitting aboard a hovercraft. Most riders equate vibrations with speed. Narrow, hard tires transmit all the road chatter to the rider. So, when we feel the road more, we believe that we're going faster, even if the speedometer says otherwise. Separate your body from such vibrations, and you suddenly think that you aren't all that fast, even if the speedometer may say otherwise. I have yet to put enough miles on the bike to figure out how the 650B wheels affect my average speed. And this year isn't representative anyway. I'm unable to train nor rest as much as in the past.</p>
<p>I was probably one of the first Swiss riders to move from 26" to 29" wheels in 2006. I lived still in the US when I bought <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157594265939262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my first 29er</a> but had already set things in motion to move back to Switzerland. I was long an advocate of the "<a href="https://www.strava.com/clubs/twentyniner-ch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bigger is better</a>" movement. Interestingly, now that the 29" wheel has become the de facto standard from XC to downhill, I find myself moving away from the trend. I own two 650B road bikes, a 27.5" fat-bike and I just put a down payment on a 27.5" mountain bike. There are some interesting months ahead, as I need to shop for components. The frameset should be arriving sometime in August.</p>

<p>The slacker geometry of the <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/">Nordest Albarda</a> gives the bike more directional stability. To put it into a turn requires therefore a more forceful steering input. This, I think, can be changed somewhat by reducing the diameter of the wheels. At least that's what happened with the Volagi, which is very agile, to begin with. In fact, with 650B wheels, that bike tends to oversteer. The Albarda should therefore improve in steerability. It was therefore long on my wishlist to equip the bike with a fast set of 650B wheels. Right at the beginning of the year, I set things in motion by ordering a pair of <a href="https://www.lightbicycle.com/650b-road-bicycle-rims-32mm-wide-35mm-deep-symmetric-clincher-road-disc-brake-available.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Light Bicycle WR35</a> gravel rims. These are 25mm internal, 32mm external hooked carbon rims with a nice 35mm deep aero profile. At the same time, I ordered a pair of Chris King R45D thru-axle Centerlock hubs from my trusted wheel builder, <a href="https://www.47grad-nord.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">47° Nord</a>. The hubs arrived at the end of March; the rims arrived in April. Black Sapim CX-Ray spokes and red DT Swiss nipples, 24 per wheel, complete the wheels.</p>

<p>All tubeless of course. Weights of any of the above? A fraction of my body weight. Stay tuned for a follow-up once I've put a few miles on the new wheels. </p>

<p>On Saturday morning I made the half-hour drive to Prés d'Orvin, which I haven't visited as often this winter. I climbed to the Jobert farm in the hope to find snowmobile tracks, but the farm was unoccupied and tracks were nowhere to be found. Pushing my bike, I stomped through deep snow for about four kilometers. The road south to the Métairie de Gléresse had not been groomed either, so my only option was to drop to the Anabaptist Bridge. Just before getting there, I noticed that a snowmobile had traveled to the Métairie Pierrefeu, so I went that way. The snowmobile track continued west, but I decided to turn around. The only rideable path was the <a href="https://www.loipen.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cross-country ski track</a> to the Place Centrale. I generally avoid those because Swiss cross-country skiers don't have the winter spirit of the Fins or the Norges and don't like to share. They pay for the use of those cross-country ski tracks, so it's understandable to a point. I hopped onto the winter hiking trail to get down into the village. The trail must have been groomed in the morning but was already in poor shape due to hiker use. In December and January, most people on foot wear snowshoes. Strangely, at the end of March, almost no one does. When I was zipping by the <a href="https://presdorvin-ski.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ski resort</a>, I saw that the lifts were operating and people were on the slopes. So, instead of riding to my car, I climbed to the top of the ski lift for a fun descent on the slope. I think I did that only one other time this winter.</p>

<p>Due to the amount of snow encountered on Saturday, I decided to try my luck at lower elevations on Sunday. Plagne, a small hilltop village just a 16-minute drive from home was my starting point. Whereas parking had been absolute chaos on weekends only a month ago, I arrived at a nearly empty parking lot. I started my ride by heading west to the "Sur Les Roches" area high above Rondchâtel. I looped back to Plagne to drop into the valley north of it. At the end of the valley there are two ways out; southeast to the Stierenberg, or north. This winter I discovered that the northern-facing climb is often used by snowmobiles, and Sunday was no different. I found some wonderful hardpack to climb to the Tiefmatt Restaurant, where a half dozen snowmobiles were parked outside. I continued to the Obergrenchenberg on the road on a mix of clean pavement, ice and snow. Unlike Prés d'Orvin the day before, the two <a href="https://www.grenchenberge.ch/grenchenberge/skilifte-grenchenberg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ski lifts of the Grenchenberg</a> were not in operation. I jumped onto a single trail to the Stierenberg and a winter hiking trail to the Montagne de Romont. The last few miles back to the car had to be ridden on sometimes wet, sometimes frozen gravel. The parking lot was just as empty as in the morning, which is probably a sign that most Swiss have grown tired of winter and desperately wait for spring to arrive. Well, I don't; my fat-bike season can never be long enough.</p>

<p>My MTB helmet choices only started to shift with fat-biking. In the winter I no longer wanted something that lets a lot of air through. A warmer helmet that covers the head more protects one’s head better from wind and snow. My first fat-bike helmet was a Bern <a href="https://products.mtbr.com/product/mtb-apparel-and-protection/helmet/bern/brentwood.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brentwood</a>, which I had bought years earlier as a helmet for my daily bike commute. It has served me well and is still being used on many of my fat-bike rides. For very cold or snowy days, I bought a Smith <a href="https://www.smithoptics.com/en_US/helmets-snow/VANTAGE-HELMET.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vantage</a>, a goggle-friendly ski helmet with ear pads and adjustable vents. So, when I'm out during a heavy snowstorm, I can completely close the front and back vents separately. On super cold days, it’s been amazing to head out with the Vantage on my head and a matching pair of Smith Optics goggles covering my eyes.</p>

<p>The Giro Aeon helmet I have been wearing for mountain biking has seen many years of use and abuse. It was time to replace it. This time, I’ve opted for a mountain-bike-specific helmet and picked a <a href="https://www.smithoptics.com/en_US/helmets-bike/FOREFRONT2-HELMET.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smith Forefront 2</a>. It falls into the most popular type of mountain bike helmets; open-face or half-shell helmets that sit a bit deeper on one's head, extending down the nape of the neck, with extra coverage around the temples. The Forefront 2 was released in 2018, so it's not a brand-new model. One of the big selling points for me are the channels on the front and rear of the helmet for eyewear storage. When I climb up a mountain, I usually take off my glasses and push them into the vents of my helmet. That works well on the front of the Giro Aeon as well as the Synthe, although the Synthe wears off the rubber padding of the earpieces over the years. The <a href="https://koroyd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Koroyd</a> construction of the Forefront 2 is said to reduce airflow, so ventilation isn’t as good as it could be. That Koroyd technology on the other hand has one benefit, bugs don’t end up crawling through one’s hair when they get trapped in a vent during a fast-speed descent through the forest. With my generally short hair, it may also better protect my head from the sun. It remains to be seen if the Forefront 2 will be too warm of a lid for summer rides. If there's one thing about summer, it's feeling hot. If so, there’s still an Aeon and a Synthe I can use. It may also turn out that the Forefront 2 will be my helmet of choice for warmer winter days.</p>

<p>Another year has rolled around and I have finally found the time to roam the dusty corners of the interweb to find the last bits to finish the bike. And since I have not been spending much during the seemingly never-ending pandemic, I shelled out some extra cash to exchange the aluminum <a href="https://rotorbike.com/catalog/default/rotor/road/cranks/aldhu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotor Aldhu</a> cranks with recently released <a href="https://rotorbike.com/catalog/default/rotor/road/cranks/aldhu-carbon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aldhu Carbon</a> cranks. The carbon version of the cranks just fits better into the overall look of the bike. They are lighter, too but I have reached an age where a few extra grams more or less do not matter. This beauty of a bike is now almost too flipping nice to be ridden. No seriously, with five bikes at my disposal and life circumstances currently throwing a wrench into my freedom to ride, I am not yet sure where the bike will fit in. But it is there on the rack, ready to hit the road when I can or want to. It does not need to be this year. It is ready when I have a permit to freely ride up and down the Swiss Jura again.</p>

                    <p class="dropcap">February has been a disappointing cycling month so far. Temperatures shot through the roof and it rained a lot. The wonderful snow disappeared at lower elevations and suffered greatly up higher. Thankfully, the mercury dropped last Friday to make Saturday the coldest day of the winter, yet. For the first time this winter I pulled my warm <a href="https://www.smithoptics.com/en_US/helmets-snow/VANTAGE-HELMET.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smith Vantage helmet</a> out of the armoire and strapped on my ski/fat-bike goggles.

<p>On Sunday, the mercury had climbed up again. While it stayed below zero, the Vantage helmet, the goggles, and thick gloves stayed at home this time.  I did the same loop as the day before with an extension to Plagne right at the start of the ride. And what an extension it was. Near the small hilltop village of Romont, I turned into a trail that was completely frozen for almost a mile. The rains and snowmelt created a large water reservoir at the end of the trail, and the trail had turned into a downright creek. When the temperatures dropped far below zero, that creek froze over entirely. I rode across it with my studded tires with a huge grin on my face.</p>

<p>By pure chance, I discovered a trail from the Stierenberg to the Grenchenberg that had been used by snowmobiles, and on Sunday observed multiple snowmobilers racing across the hills, which by the way is illegal in this country. I guess no one complains and no one checks because you can't hide snowmobile tracks crisscrossing the open hillsides in every direction. My feelings about that are somewhat mixed. As a fat-biker in a country where you just have to ride whatever is rideable in the winter, snowmobile tracks are super useful to travel through the winter world. On the other hand, these things burn fuel and with their speed and noise are problematic for the wildlife that needs to make it through the winter. There are ways to use them responsibly, but what I watched Sunday was anything but responsible.</p>

<p>Leaving home the ride starts with climbing 2'000 feet to reach a winter wonderland crisscrossed by countless snowshoe trails and groomed gravel roads that connect the numerous vacation homes along the top of the mountain. Some of the snowshoe trails are marked, and many are not. Once the sun drops low, it's time to return home. A beautiful, but at times risky downhill trail quickly destroys the 2'000 feet and spits me out into a fun labyrinth of trees. In the summer, it's easy to follow a footpath through those woods. In the winter, the most fun is not to get lost in the maze of trees, especially in the late afternoon when daylight is darkening. As long as the weather permits, I'll be fat-biking up there. It's a lot more convenient to start at the house without having to drive someplace.</p>

Due to our move in 2019, which saw my riding time greatly reduced for the second part of the year, I hoped to get back to a 2018 level in 2020. But that wasn’t possible. The pandemic had little to do with it. We had a few months with short time at work, which would have given me more time to ride.

<p>We were lucky with them for the majority of their lives. They had an unlucky start into life and were quite sick when we adopted them, but up until early last year, they had never fallen ill. A pair of healthy cats don’t take much time. We used to feed them twice a day, they need a clean litterbox, various places to sleep, toys, and some playtime. When you’re on the couch it usually takes no time and a cat climbs onto your lap. If you try to provide some comfort of life for a chronically ill cat, however, a lot more of one’s time has to be given to your pet. My wife has done the brunt of the work and I basically halved my time riding. I still tried to head out regularly, but tremendously shorted the time out on a ride.</p>

<p>In a road cycling heavy May, I managed to cover 812 kilometers, but for the remainder of the year, my <a href="https://tinyurl.com/patrickstrahm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monthly mileage totals</a> never climb back as high. In mid-April, my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-sl/">Volagi Viaje</a> received a new wheelset by <a href="https://www.blackcatwheels.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Cat Wheels</a> built with Kinlin TL-23 rims and Industry 9 Centerlock hubs. At the end of July, I sold my amazing Fortyfour Big Boy fat-bike; a bike with which I amassed 8’585 kilometers during 907 hours. In August, I gave my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-marauder/">44 Marauder</a> a <a href="https://offtrail.guru/another-cockpit-change/">cockpit upgrade</a> going from a Jones H-Bar Bend to a Ritchey Comp Kyote handlebar. Ultimately in September, I upgraded my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/">Nordest Albarda</a> to SRAM Red eTap AXS. My fat-bike season began with the first snowfall in the Jura on November 21st and continued all through December.</p>

<p>2021 will continue in the same fashion. Rides will remain short but hopefully regular. There’s an upgrade to my fat-bike I’ve been wanting to do, but for now, the parts are unavailable. My Albarda will be getting a 650B wheelset with Light-Bicycle <a href="https://www.lightbicycle.com/650b-road-bicycle-rims-32mm-wide-35mm-deep-symmetric-clincher-road-disc-brake-available.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WR35 carbon rims</a> and Chris King R45D hubs. At the end of spring or the beginning of summer, I would love to get my hands on a <a href="http://stoogecycles.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stooge</a> MK5. The trails up the hillside behind our house are too steep for a single-speed and riding it up the paved road just isn’t something I do. To fully take advantage of the trail network around our house I need a geared mountain bike with a rigid geometry to hit the steep descents. Without going custom, a Stooge MK5 looks perfect for just that.</p>

                    <p class="dropcap">Right in time for the <a href="https://fat-bike.com/2020/09/global-fat-bike-day-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Global Fat-Bike Day 2020</a>, a low-pressure system brought lots of humidity from the south and turned our mountains into a gorgeous winter wonderland. Five, six years ago, when fat-biking saw a boom, we managed to get a half dozen people together for the occasion. I had honestly not paid attention to GFBD this year as I've not been able to devote as much time to cycling as I would have liked. It was only after <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CIbFFCnlj-I/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">instagramming</a> my ride on Saturday that I realized that it coincided with GFBD2020. My Instagram post was tagged appropriately to mark the occasion.</p>

Five, six years ago, when fat-biking saw a boom, we managed to get a half dozen people together for the occasion.

<p>I drove up to Les Prés d'Orvin on Saturday and returned once more on Sunday. With 30 centimeters of fresh snow, tire tracks dictated my loop on Saturday. On Sunday temperatures rose a little and the snow was heavier. My tires found a lot more grip. I climbed to the top of the ski slope. Gravity, after all, is strong enough to pull a fat-biker through deep, fresh powder. While far from being a fast descent, it's always a fun experience. At the bottom of the ski slope, I turned west to follow a winter hiking trail that had already been groomed. It would have been a good day to head out to the Chasseral and jump onto the snowshoe trail along the crest to return. But for that, I left too late. Speaking of snowshoeing, I think that this popular winter activity will experience more growth due to the pandemic this year. In previous years it usually took more time to have a rideable network of snowshoe trails.<br><br>Stats for the weekend: 47.1km ridden, 5h 54m in the saddle, 1'412m climbed. I may have to return this weekend. While rain is forecast for the lowlands, it should be snowing above 1'000m (3'300ft).</p>
