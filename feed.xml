<p>How wide is too wide? I wonder about this question and hope to find the answer on the next leg of my journey. Wide tires fit best on wide rims, so the new wheels use 30mm internal <a href="https://www.lightbicycle.com/700C-gravel-bicycle-rims-40mm-wide-44mm-deep-aero-clincher.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WG44 carbon rims</a> by Light Bicycle. They will securely hook René Herse <a href="https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/700c/700cx55-antelope-hill-tc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antelope Hill</a> (700x55) tires. Tubeless, of course. Light Bicycle used a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/870363693078977/posts/our-new-hybrid-hook-design-aims-to-improve-tire-fitment-even-further-when-the-hy/5659842387464393/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hybrid hook design</a> to improve tire fitment for the WG44 rims. Hookless rims combined with supple tires are an absolute no-go for me. You may be wondering why anyone would ride so much rubber on pavement. Because it’s fun and because it’s fast. Fast? You gotta be kidding. Granted, you may not be winning any KOMs going uphill. But you stand a good chance of grabbing every KOM going downhill. And you’ll do it with confidence and a huge smile on your face. But speed isn’t as much on my mind these days. I’m after grip, security, all-day comfort, and pure fun and pleasure. If 55mm turns out to be too much, I can go back to 44mm or pick a <a href="https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/700c/700c-x-48-hatcher-pass-tc-tire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hatcher Pass</a> 48mm in between.</p>

<p>I generally pick the Rolls-Royce of bicycle hubs, Chris King, for the kernel of my wheels. I have two wheelsets with <a href="https://chrisking.com/collections/r45d-centerlock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R45D Centerlock</a> hubs. On the roadside of things, I also own two wheelsets with <a href="https://industrynine.com/hubs/road_disc/classic-road-disc-cl-rear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Industry 9 Torch</a> hubs. Centerlock, as well. Much more important than the brand, though, is versatility. Bike hubs need to be adaptable and should best be somewhat future-proof. You should always be able to change them from QR to through-axle or vice versa with just a few parts. You should also be able to pick a Shimano HG, SRAM XD/R, or MicroSpline freehub body without needing a new wheel. If hubs don’t offer such flexibility, I don’t buy them.</p>

<p>For the <a href="https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12/">MGX12</a>, however, I didn’t want to shell out a big chunk of cash for Chris King. They're amazing hubs with an unmatched quality, but they leave a big hole in one's wallet. Instead, I opted for more affordable and extremely versatile <a href="https://www.hopetech.com/news/the-all-new-pro-5-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hope Pro 5</a> hubs. They’re available with all modern freehub bodies and end spacers to suit different frame and axle standards. They're also offered in six anodizations. So, exactly what I want from a pair of hubs. As always, the wheels were masterfully laced by Patrik at <a href="https://www.47grad-nord.ch/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">47º Nord</a>.</p>

Besides, when you can take an 11-year-old Volagi Viaje and throw the very newest components on it, where’s the reason to moan and groan? Standards haven’t changed all that much. You just need to be smart about the bikes and components you’re choosing.</p>

<p>I had a very clear idea of how I was going to convert the Nordest Albarda to 1x12. Things were a bit fuzzy with the Viaje. Initially, I thought about using the same setup as on the <a href="https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12/">Marin Gestalt X12</a>, SRAM Rival AXS XPLR. Then, I noticed that I could get the recently released Force AXS XPLR for only a little bit more money. But I’m using neither of the two. I stumbled upon Garbaruk’s <a href="https://www.garbaruk.com/sram-12-speed-axs-rd-cage.html?category=25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cage kit</a> for SRAM AXS road derailleurs. And I removed just such a derailleur from my Nordest. The most cost-effective way to bring the Viaje into the 1x12 era is to use the SRAM Red AXS derailleur I already have, replace its cage, and buy a pair of Rival AXS shift/brake levers. They’re inexpensive, and their stealth black finish looks cool, too. The Garbaruk cage is black with red pulleys to match the bike’s color scheme.</p>

                    <p class="dropcap">My <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/">Nordest Albarda</a> was built on a budget in the fall of 2019. I used a Nox Composites wheelset that had previously been on my red <a href="https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-sl/">Volagi Viaje</a>. The braking system and 2x11-speed SRAM Red eTap HRD drivetrain were borrowed from my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/ritte-snob-disc/">Ritte</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 2020, I purchased a SRAM Red AXS groupset for the Nordest and moved the eTap HRD parts back to the Ritte. In the spring of 2021, I asked <a href="https://www.47grad-nord.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">47° Nord</a> to lace a pair of Chris King R45D hubs to a set of Light Bicycle <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda-on-650b/">650B</a> WR35 carbon rims.

                <p class="dropcap">My <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/">Nordest Albarda</a> was built on a budget in the fall of 2019. I used a Nox Composites wheelset that had previously been on my red <a href="https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-sl/">Volagi Viaje</a>. The braking system and 2x11-speed SRAM Red eTap HRD drivetrain were borrowed from my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/ritte-snob-disc/">Ritte</a>.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In 2020, I purchased a SRAM Red AXS groupset for the Nordest and moved the eTap HRD parts back to the Ritte. In the spring of 2021, I asked <a href="https://www.47grad-nord.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">47° Nord</a> to lace a pair of Chris King R45D hubs to a set of Light Bicycle <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda-on-650b/">650B</a> WR35 carbon rims. That’s how I’ve ridden the bike for the last two and a half years, sometimes <a href="https://offtrail.guru/back-on-700c-wheels/">swapping out</a> the wheels using the Nox with grippier tires during the winter months.</p>

<p>Some cyclists replace their bikes every year and never bother to change much. They may replace tires, brake pads, chains, and maybe even a cassette. Besides that, a new setup only comes with a new bike. I prefer to hold onto a bike if it’s fun. I also enjoy to keep tuning it. Sometimes, the job at hand is only about replacing old and/or worn parts. Other times, it’s about changing fit and function altogether. The complex interaction between a bike and me depends largely on my own variability. As I’m aging, my physical capabilities are the largest factor in that intricate person-machine relationship. A bike setup that felt right just a few years ago may no longer be right today. Upgrading the machine is, therefore, often about keeping the machinist smile.</p>

<p>My human motor was more finely tuned and performed best when matched to a 2x drivetrain with a tightly spaced cassette just a few years ago. Thanks to the latest addition to my bike stable, the <a href="https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12/">Marin Gestalt X12</a>, I discovered that my 54-year-old diesel engine runs quite smoothly when allowed to power a simple 1x12 drivetrain. I love simplification. Getting rid of the front derailleur has lots of benefits. It’s one less battery to keep charged. From a mechanical point of view, a front derailleur is a pretty crude method to move a chain from one chainring to the other. It causes both the chain and the chainrings to wear out faster. Also, I rarely use the smallest three cogs in the big ring (48T). With a 1x12 drivetrain, on the other hand, every cog gets its fair share of work. So, the time has come to match the Nordest Albarda to the preferences of this new old guy.</p>

<p>That said, there’s a chance I’m sending the Nordest Albarda frameset into temporary retirement and move all its components to a new frameset in 2024. A frameset with a nearly identical wheelbase, less BB drop, more reach, and a slightly steeper head tube angle caught my attention. If I do, you’ll read it here.</p>

                    <p class="dropcap">The last time my wife and I traveled was in October 2017. We drove to Nice to meet an American friend who happened to spend a few days there. We used the trip to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/37258753184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nice</a> to visit a bunch of wineries in the Rhône Valley.

<p>Lately, my blog has focused more on equipment and gear than rides because I do all my riding from home. I have not been able to spend the time I would like on the saddle, so rides aren’t long nor particularly adventurous. So, there just isn’t much interesting to report about. This past seven days, I took a staycation and took advantage of the dry, sunny conditions to hit the trails on my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/stooge-mk5/">Stooge</a>. While some days were at my heat limit, I got out for 3-hour rides daily. The trails were spectacular. Looking at the leaf-covered ground, one felt like being in the middle of autumn. Looking at the foliage, though, autumn seems nowhere yet. That isn’t good. The forests at our latitudes aren’t used to the kind of heat we’re experiencing, and they’re suffering from heat stress. It remains to be seen if our trees are going to carry the beautiful fall colors that they should in the weeks to come or if they’re going to drop their foliage as rapidly as some already have.</p>

                    <p class="dropcap">As climate change is lengthening summers and making them frighteningly hotter, summers for cyclists or anyone else exercising outdoors, for that matter, are already getting a lot shorter. The two heatwaves that hit Switzerland's northern half shortened my 2023 summer cycling already by a whole month in which I was off the bike. In those four weeks, I didn’t exercise at all and spent little time outdoors. I only caught a bit of fresh air, if one can even call it "fresh" when I sat under our sun shades on the balcony with my laptop and a cold <a href="https://lagunitas.com/beer/ipa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lagunitas IPA</a>. Instead of hitting the road or climbing trails, weekends were spent inside watching Netflix or Apple TV.</p>

<p>I’ve noticed on <a href="https://www.strava.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strava</a> that many cyclists I follow, who take their training more seriously, have switched to riding indoors. It was rare to see a <a href="https://www.zwift.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zwift</a> activity during the summer months just a year or two ago. Most switch to training indoors when the days get shorter and colder. Now, a considerable number of cyclists trained indoors because the summer of 2023 was too damn hot.</p>
<p>Cycling, for me, has to be fun, enjoyable, and healthy. Once the thermometer passes 25°C, these three things start to dive, and the higher the relative humidity, the quicker they dive. If the air is dry, it can remain enjoyable at 30+°C. But if it’s muggy, the fun is gone. I also put great importance to only doing what benefits my health, and exercising in the heat is anything but healthy. On the contrary, you unnecessarily stress your body, even damage it, and in the worst case, put yourself in danger.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>A strenuous bike ride can already become dangerous at 30°C and a relative humidity above 55%. <a href="https://arielschecklist.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ariel's Checklist</a>, a website with safety guidelines for hiking in the desert, has a tremendous <a href="https://arielschecklist.com/wbgt-chart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wet bulb temperature chart</a> showing the danger of physical activity at different combinations of temperature and humidity. I don't need to check the chart. I wouldn't even leave the house when conditions reach the red levels.</p>

<p>2023 has been a scary year. Heat waves have paralyzed the American South from east to west. It has hit large parts of Asia, the Middle East, as well as Europe, particularly the Mediterranean. Huge wildfires engulfed Canada, Portugal, Greece, and tropical Hawaii, where the fire that destroyed Lahaina became the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hawaii_wildfires#Casualties" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deadliest</a> US blaze in a century. Heat waves also always lead to heavy thunderstorms and flooding. There have been floods in India, Mongolia, California, Slovenia, Italy, and Norway, to name a few. As we're in an <a href="https://www.weather.gov/news/230706-ElNino" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">El Niño</a> year, this will continue well into 2024. El Niño transports humidity away from Asia and Australia to North and South America. When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_the_El_Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern_Oscillation_in_Australia#El_Ni%C3%B1o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Australia</a> heads into summer, that continent will be a tinderbox. The US West Coast will see lots of floods. Living in California, I experienced El Niño in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997%E2%80%9398_El_Ni%C3%B1o_event" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1997-1998</a>. It was regarded as one of the most powerful El Niño Southern Oscillation events in recorded history. And it was quite bad. At the same time, oceans across the globe have reached surface temperatures like we have never seen before. The August heat wave pushed the zero-degree line in the Swiss Alps to <a href="https://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/ueber-uns/meteoschweiz-blog/de/2023/08/die-rekorde-purzeln.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5,298 meters</a> above sea level. In other words, every alpine glacier was melting.</p>
<p>I don't think mankind is going to reverse the civilization-ending trajectory it’s on. Science has known since the 50ies what will happen to the planet when humans burn fossil fuels. The public has been well aware of it since the 80ies. Forty years later, we have done shit about it. People think that governments will somehow fix it. In the meantime, they fly across the globe for a Christmas holiday on a beach in Thailand or board a plane for a shopping weekend in New York. Rather than downsizing, our homes and cars are only getting bigger. The capitalist system that we live in demands that we consume more and more. A larger flat-screen TV every couple of years, a new cell phone every year, new clothes every few months; it's oil to keep our economy running smoothly. Without growth, it would collapse. We're depleting our planet’s resources and heating up its precious atmosphere. I used to think that it'll take a couple more generations until mankind is going to be in trouble. Not anymore. These events are upon us much faster, and we’ll experience them on our own skin.</p>
<p>In the coming years, natural disasters caused by the climate catastrophe are going to burden First World economies heavily. Heat waves will kill those without the luxury of air-conditioning. The number of refugees currently crossing the Mediterranean Sea will be dwarfed by the millions of climate refugees who will be forced to leave large <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/10/11/extreme-heat-heatwave-deaths/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">uninhabitable</a>, equatorial regions in Africa, India, and elsewhere. Europe won’t be welcoming but become a fortress. The Swiss forests I enjoy on my bike, <a href="https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home/topics/forest/in-brief.html#:~:text=The%20hot%2C%20dry%20summers%20of,extremes%20or%20even%20died%20off." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unable to cope</a> with the heat, will start dying off. Like elsewhere in the world, our forests will burn, too. Our water supply will no longer be guaranteed when our <a href="https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/society/swiss-glacier-series--0-1-000m-_melting-swiss-glaciers-to-fuel-conflicts-over-water-/45371008" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">alpine glaciers</a> are gone. Without enough water, farming will become increasingly difficult. And to come back to cycling, summers will be three months of <a href="https://www.zwift.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zwift</a> with the AC on full power, provided the power grid doesn’t collapse.</p>
<p>Maybe you say, “Oh, Patrick, you’re a pessimist.” I don’t think so. I’m a realist. Forty years ago, there was still time to be optimistic. To be optimistic today is to live in a fantasy. We’re not willing to change our destructive lifestyles. We want our vacations, we want our homes, we want our cars, and we want our stuff. A world on fire won’t change us. Maybe it’ll change our children or grandchildren if they manage to survive, but certainly not us.</p>

                    <p class="dropcap">With a fleet of six bikes, of which three are surface-agnostic SUBs, commonly better known as gravel, all-road, or adventure bikes, I didn’t need another one this year.

<p>Visually, I love the result. I purposely purchased a large frame. The 440mm reach and 175mm head tube, in combination with a <a href="https://www.syntace.com/en_GB/products/stems/mountain-bike/2988/flatforce-44" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Syntace FlatForce 44</a> stem, placed the handlebar where I needed it to be. Having the right look is nice, but optics ultimately don’t matter. A bike has to deliver. And that it does. Built as it is, the bike weighs 8.9 kilograms. Climbing out of the saddle with my hands on the hoods, the Gestalt tackles every climb in a neutral manner. It swings from side to side perfectly harmoniously with my body movement without veering left and right with every pull on the bar. When going downhill, the bike feels fast yet safe. It requires more rider input to initiate a change of direction, but I like controlling a bike with a bit of aggression. It doesn’t offer the best aero position with a 46cm wide gravel bar, but I’m out to have fun and not to win a time trial.</p>

<p>From 2015 to 2018, I took the first crack at riding 1x11 with SRAM Force CX1 on two different <a href="https://offtrail.guru/old-gravel-bikes/">bikes</a>. For most gravel rides, it was okay, but it lacked the gearing range with an 11-32T cassette. On very steep gravel climbs, I was missing a small gear, and on paved flats, I could have pushed a bigger gear. When I replaced my black Volagi Viaje CX with the Nordest Albarda, I went back to two chainrings up front. SRAM’s 1x12 <a href="https://www.sram.com/en/sram/xplr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XPLR drivetrain</a> in the flavors Red, Force, or Rival extends the <a href="https://www.sram.com/en/sram/xplr/xplr?filters=cattype|Cassettes&amp;sort=&amp;page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cassette</a> both ways (10-44T). Combined with a 42T chainring, I now feel like I have the gear range to ride everywhere. Years ago, I preferred the tight gear steps of smaller cassettes. I no longer mind the larger gear jumps of a 12-speed XPLR cassette. I often didn’t find the right cog with the old 11-32T cassette in climbs. I don't seem to have that problem on the wider XPLR cassette now. It’s been such a positive experience that I’m going to convert my Nordest Albarda and my Volagi Viaje to 1x12 as well. The Nordest will be first at the end of the year. The Volagi will follow in the spring of 2024.</p>

That changed with my first <a href="https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-sl/">Volagi Viaje</a>. I started exploring things outside what is considered a “road bike.”</p>

<p>Without fixation on grams and watts and without having to worry about keeping up in a group ride, my view on the “ideal” road bike has evolved. Today, I take a different approach to cycling and say “If it ain’t broke, break it.” The Volagi Viajes and the <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/">Nordest Albarda</a> were mostly about discovering wider tires and smaller wheels. I went from <a href="https://offtrail.guru/40-is-the-new-28/">28mm to 38mm</a> and landed at 48mm wide tires. To fit this tire width and to keep the bikes lively and agile, I swapped 700C wheels <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda-on-650b/">for 650B</a>. The Nordest was a first sniff at a slacker frame geometry in combination with a lower bottom bracket. The Marin Gestalt X12 however, allowed me to throw everything I know overboard. It’s a gravel bike, unlike any other gravel bike I’ve ridden. It has a <a href="https://offtrail.guru/the-geometry-of-a-gravel-bike/">geometry</a> that heavily borrows from a modern mountain bike. Its head tube angle is slacker than any of my mountain bikes. It has a long reach, a short stem, and a long wheelbase. I also set it up with a wider handlebar than what I’ve ridden up to now.</p>

<p>Road.cc recently ran a feature on the rising cost of cycling. An <a href="https://www.specialized.com/ch/de/s-works-tarmac-sl7---shimano-dura-ace-di2/p/199463" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S-Works Tarmac SL7</a> or a <a href="https://www.trekbikes.com/ch/de_CH/bikes/rennr%C3%A4der/performance-rennr%C3%A4der/madone/madone-slr/madone-slr-9-axs-gen-7/p/37420/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trek Madone SLR 9</a> can cost you upwards of CHF 15’000.00. On the gravel side of things, you have the <a href="https://www.specialized.com/ch/en/diverge-str-pro/p/200577" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S-Works Diverge STR</a> with an SRAM Red/XX1 mullet setup setting you back CHF 10’000.00. As a young whippersnapper, I would have lusted over these financially out-of-reach bikes. Now in my mid-fifties, such outrageously expensive bikes no longer spark my interest. Could I afford one? Yeah, I could! Would I? No, that money is better invested in my retirement account. Cycling is more fun on equipment far cheaper than that. I would even argue that if you sell one of your kidneys for a high-end bike, you will never be honest with yourself about the quality of the bike. It will be the best bike you have owned, even if it causes you back pain and rides terribly. If an inexpensive bike turns out to be a poor fit, you will have no problem admitting it to yourself or your riding buddies.</p>

<p>The good news is that there are still companies out there that try to package fun into affordability. They do so without silly technical gimmicks or claimed aerodynamic improvements but with simple bikes that try nothing more than put a smile on a rider’s face. And when I’m on a bike that’s what truly counts, not grams and watts. One such company is <a href="https://www.marinbikes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marin</a>. As someone who got into mountain biking in the mid-eighties, Marin is a familiar name. The company has its roots in that era, and its bikes were quite popular at the time. To be honest, Marin sort of disappeared off my radar screen. One recent day, while googling for gravel bikes with slacker head tube angles, I came across Marin’s <a href="https://www.marinbikes.com/bikes/2023-gestalt-x10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023 Gestalt X10</a>. I loved it at first sight. The frame geometry, the tube shapes, the tire clearance, the colors, and particularly the price. Browsing their whole catalog of bike offerings, I discovered that that’s what they do nowadays - affordable and attractive no-nonsense bikes for cyclists who cannot throw the entirety of their disposable incomes at their hobby.</p>

<p>The Gestalt X10 can be purchased for CHF 1'629.00. At that price, it comes with mechanical disc brakes by Tektro, a MicroSHIFT Advent X 10-speed derailleur, and an aluminum handlebar, seat post, and rims. It’s not a bike that would catch anyone’s interest in Switzerland because none of the components say Shimano or SRAM. And without an additional zero to its price tag, it’s a cheap man’s bike in this nation anyway. In fact, when I contacted the bike shop about it, they said they wouldn’t stock it because of the mechanical disc brakes. Swiss cyclists apparently only want hydraulic brakes. While I prefer hydraulic disc brakes for the hilly Jura, I had two bikes with <a href="https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=77168304%40N00&amp;view_all=1&amp;text=spyre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TRP Spyre</a> brakes. On flat terrain, they performed just fine. The independent pad adjustment and the simple fact that you can maintain everything with a few Allen keys instead of a bleed kit still make such brakes a valid option. It’s a bit under-geared for me with a 42T chainring and an 11-51T SunRace cassette. I pulled off all the original components, which I’m keeping for the day I want to sell the bike. Instead of the OEM parts, I tuned it up with the components listed below. All in all, I spent CHF 3’200.00 to build the X10 into an X12. At the moment the X12 is set up with a <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/tags/nox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">7-year-old</a> Nox Composites Citico wheelset. I will be ordering a pair of Light Bicycle <a href="https://www.lightbicycle.com/700C-gravel-bicycle-rims-40mm-wide-44mm-deep-aero-clincher.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WG44 rims</a> in August to have them laced up to <a href="https://www.hopetech.com/news/the-all-new-pro-5-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hope Pro 5</a> hubs in early October. A new bike deserves a <a href="https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12-on-new-wheels/">new pair</a> of wheels.</p>

                <p class="dropcap">The bikes I ride on pavement or gravel are more than road, all-road, or gravel bikes. They are efficient, practical, surface-agnostic bikes that bridge the functionality gap between road and off-road. In this post, I want to look at the geometry of the bikes I have ridden in the last nine years.</p>

<p>I started on a red <a href="https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-sl/">Volagi Viaje</a> with 700C wheels in March 2014. The Viaje, introduced on <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/874048428/the-viaje-bicycle-engineered-for-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kickstarter</a> in August of 2012, was a bike ahead of its time. Its frame and fork had enough clearance for 40mm wide 700C tires and offered plenty of room for 650B <a href="https://www.wtb.com/collections/road-plus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RoadPlus</a> tires. It was engineered for adventure. Many today equate adventure with bike-packing, so in this day and age, I would not view the Viaje as an ideal adventure bike. It lacks the many mounting points to carry bags, and the magnificent Long Bow Flex Stays cannot handle much more than the weight of the rider. I loved it, though, and I still do. Born in 2012, the Volagi Viaje had a fairly traditional road bike geometry. It rode like a road bike with a head angle of 72º, a BB drop of 70 mm, short chain stays, and a short wheelbase. It was agile and quick steering. It was fun on <a href="https://offtrail.guru/gravel-grinding/">gravel</a>, but I always had to pay attention to where it was going. This got even more pronounced when I built my third Viaje with 650B wheels. Equipped with smaller wheels, the Volagi Viaje tends to oversteer when leaning into a turn.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/">Nordest Albarda</a> I built in the fall of 2019 is a different machine. Nordest designed it more along the lines of a comfort bike. A semi-slack head tube angle of 70º and a high 74mm trail result in a bike with a lot of steering stability. One can more easily take the eyes off the road without immediately veering into the ditch. The 28mm longer front center is another good indicator of a well-mannered ride feel. Thanks to the short chainstays and extremely low bottom bracket the Albarda is by no means lethargic. It comes to life at speed. One thing to point out is that I went with a custom geometry because the stock geometry was a bit too upright for my taste. I ordered a medium frame with a 15mm shorter head tube - the head tube of a small. From October 2019 to March 2021, I rode the bike on 700C wheels. In the <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda-2021-update/">spring of 2021</a>, I swapped the groupset from a 2x11-speed SRAM Red eTap HRD to a 2x12 Red AXS groupset and went 650B. This reduces the trail from 74mm to about 68mm and slightly lowers the wheel flop. And it is noticeable! Like the Volagi Viaje, I prefer the Nordest Albarda with 650B wheels.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.marinbikes.com/bikes/2023-gestalt-x10" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023 Marin Gestalt X10</a> is a whole different beast. The vast majority of gravel bikes are essentially nothing more than road bikes with room for large tires. The Marin X10 and XR, on the other hand, borrow a lot from modern mountain bikes. And that's why I pulled the trigger and got one. So, what about that geometry? The most eye-popping differences are head tube angle, reach, and a dramatically elongated front-center as a combination of the two. To keep my position, I shortened the stem from 110/100 mm (Viaje/Albarda) to 44 mm. I mounted a wider handlebar to better deal with the very high trail figure and the increased wheel flop. It’s an <a href="https://eastoncycling.com/products/ec70-ax-bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Easton EC70 AX</a> in 46 cm. With a 16º flare, the bar has 53 cm in the drops. Maybe also to note, based on Marin’s sizing chart, I’m smack in between an M and an L. I went with a large. The next couple of weeks will show if Marin is onto something with such an MTB-inspired, hard-charging, rough-and-rowdy gravel/adventure bike.</p>

                <p class="dropcap">I like shopping on Ali Express. Not so much because it’s cheap, but because I find things no one else sells. Truth be told, I ran across the <a href="https://www.cycplus.com/products/tiny-pump-cube" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cycplus Cube</a> on Youtube first. Cycplus introduced this electric bicycle pump on <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/cycplus-cube-tiny-bike-pump#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Indiegogo</a> in February this year. The project was fully funded within 12 hours. Cycplus was established in Chengdu, China, in 2014. They make other pumps and also offer various cycling computers. Like many other such companies, they didn’t go to Indiegogo for the funding but to gauge the interest for such a tiny pump. Had I not seen videos of how well this small pump inflates a bicycle tire, I wouldn’t have ordered one from the company’s <a href="https://cycplus.aliexpress.com/store/5796744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">storefront</a> on Ali Express. But that tiny thing actually works. Like everything else I’ve purchased on Ali Express, the Cycplus Cube arrived at my doorstep in Grenchen, Switzerland in no time. A small package takes an 8'000 kilometer journey and arrives a little over a week later. What a small world! The air intake was the first thing I was confused about when I held it in my hands. The air from the pump’s nozzle must come from somewhere, and I didn’t know from where. I grabbed the small manual to find out that the USB-C charging port is also the pump’s air intake. How cool is that? I charged and then tested the pump by inflating a 29er bike tire. The pump did that in about a minute and a half. I didn’t test how many tires I could inflate on a single battery charge, but based on how quickly it was fully recharged, I think I could have easily inflated another two tires.</p>

<p>I know cyclists who don’t carry any tools with them. They have a cell phone and a wife at home who will drop everything to pick them up whenever their bike breaks down. My wife would be mildly annoyed if I would call her each time I needed help. I rather carry a small toolkit with me to help myself. This toolkit used to be heavier. It has gotten smaller as I reduced it to the bare minimum. The Cube has now freed one jersey pocket in which I used to carry a small dual-stage hand pump. I can bring along my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/dji-action-2/">DJI Action 2</a> camera with a small tripod in that free pocket instead.</p>

<p>In 2011 I switched brands. I rode <a href="https://www.fizik.com/eu_en/antares-r1.html">Fizik Antares</a> saddles in various models for the next eight years. There were R1, R3 with carbon braided rails or less expensive K:ium metal rails. My 44 Kid Dangerous 29er and my 44 Big Boy fat bike were given the top-of-the-line <a href="https://www.fizik.com/eu_en/antares-00.html">Antares 00</a>. An Antares VS was on my red Volagi, and an <a href="https://www.fizik.com/eu_en/antares-r1-versus-evo.html">R1 Versus EVO</a> still sits on top of my beige <a href="https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-sl/">Volagi</a>. When I rebuilt my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/ritte-snob-disc/">Ritte Snob Disc</a> road bike, I gave it the latest generation Antares 00. The Antares uses a generously proportioned rear and a relatively firm carbon-reinforced shell. Its flat shape meshes well with my anatomy and offers excellent long-distance comfort.</p>

<p>In 2019 the third saddle transition unfolded with the construction of my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/">Nordest Albarda</a>. After years of extra-long saddle designs, several manufacturers introduced saddles with a sawed-off nose. Prologo was one of them with the 245mm short Dimension. That’s 30mm shorter than the Fizik Antares saddles I was used to. The Prologo <a href="https://prologo.it/en/products/dimension-143">Dimension Nack</a> has a big pressure-relief channel, plenty of high-density padding, and a superbly comfortable, stepped nose. It was an immediate love affair. When it came to picking a saddle for my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/stooge-mk5/">Stooge MK5</a> rigid 27.5+ mountain bike, it was a no-brainer that the choice fell onto another short Prologo saddle.</p>

<p>Because I don’t find open-channel saddles practical for dirt or gravel riding, I selected the <a href="https://prologo.it/en/collections/marathon-xc/products/scratch-m5">Scratch M5</a> for the MK5. Prologo says that the rounded shape of the Scratch M5 allows the pelvis to rotate naturally. It favors the distribution of pressure over a larger surface area, creates stability, and supports the lumbar region. I’m not expert enough to confirm that, but my butt definitely likes sitting on it. My Marin Gestalt X12 will be equipped with the same Scratch M5, while both Fortyfours will say goodbye to the Antares 00 to welcome the latest of the Prologo saddle family, the <a href="https://prologo.it/en/collections/marathon-xc/products/scratch-ndr">Scratch NDR</a> with Nack rails. The ergonomic Scratch NDR is the off-road evolution of the Scratch M5 and is specifically designed for XC and marathon riding.</p>
