                    <p class="dropcap">Back in the early days of mountain biking, bike helmets used to be bike helmets. Road cyclists were only just starting to put lids on and there were basically no sport-specific helmets. An XC mountain biker wore the same helmet as a road cyclist. Things have changed a lot in that regard. Mountain bikers today have a huge plethora of helmets to choose from; from lightweight XC helmets to full-face downhill helmets. For the three and a half decades I have been riding, I have primarily owned visorless road cycling helmets except for two Giro <a href="https://products.roadbikereview.com/product/clothing/helmets/giro/exodus.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exodus</a> helmets, which were popular mountain bike helmets in early 2000.

<p>My MTB helmet choices only started to shift with fat-biking. In the winter I no longer wanted something that lets a lot of air through. A warmer helmet that covers the head more protects one’s head better from wind and snow. My first fat-bike helmet was a Bern <a href="https://products.mtbr.com/product/mtb-apparel-and-protection/helmet/bern/brentwood.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brentwood</a>, which I had bought years earlier as a helmet for my daily bike commute. It has served me well and is still being used on many of my fat-bike rides. For very cold or snowy days, I bought a Smith <a href="https://www.smithoptics.com/en_US/helmets-snow/VANTAGE-HELMET.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vantage</a>, a goggle-friendly ski helmet with ear pads and adjustable vents. So, when I'm out during a heavy snowstorm, I can completely close the front and back vents separately. On super cold days, it’s been amazing to head out with the Vantage on my head and a matching pair of Smith Optics goggles covering my eyes.</p>

<p>The Giro Aeon helmet I have been wearing for mountain biking has seen many years of use and abuse. It was time to replace it. This time, I’ve opted for a mountain-bike-specific helmet and picked a <a href="https://www.smithoptics.com/en_US/helmets-bike/FOREFRONT2-HELMET.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smith Forefront 2</a>. It falls into the most popular type of mountain bike helmets; open-face or half-shell helmets that sit a bit deeper on one's head, extending down the nape of the neck, with extra coverage around the temples. The Forefront 2 was released in 2018, so it's not a brand-new model. One of the big selling points for me are the channels on the front and rear of the helmet for eyewear storage. When I climb up a mountain, I usually take off my glasses and push them into the vents of my helmet. That works well on the front of the Giro Aeon as well as the Synthe, although the Synthe wears off the rubber padding of the earpieces over the years. The Koroyd construction of the Forefront 2 is said to reduce airflow, so ventilation isn’t as good as it could be. That Koroyd technology on the other hand has one benefit, bugs don’t end up crawling through one’s hair when they get trapped in a vent during a fast-speed descent through the forest. With my generally short hair, it may also better protect my head from the sun. It remains to be seen if the Forefront 2 will be too warm of a lid for summer rides. If there's one thing about summer, it's feeling hot. If so, there’s still an Aeon and a Synthe I can use. It may also turn out that the Forefront 2 will be my helmet of choice for warmer winter days.</p>

<p>Another year has rolled around and I have finally found the time to roam the dusty corners of the interweb to find the last bits to finish the bike. And since I have not been spending much during the seemingly never-ending pandemic, I shelled out some extra cash to exchange the aluminum <a href="https://rotorbike.com/catalog/default/rotor/road/cranks/aldhu.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotor Aldhu</a> cranks with recently released <a href="https://rotorbike.com/catalog/default/rotor/road/cranks/aldhu-carbon.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aldhu Carbon</a> cranks. The carbon version of the cranks just fits better into the overall look of the bike. They are lighter, too but I have reached an age where a few extra grams more or less do not matter. This beauty of a bike is now almost too flipping nice to be ridden. No seriously, with five bikes at my disposal and life circumstances currently throwing a wrench into my freedom to ride, I am not yet sure where the bike will fit in. But it is there on the rack, ready to hit the road when I can or want to. It does not need to be this year. It is ready when I have a permit to freely ride up and down the Swiss Jura again.</p>

                    <p class="dropcap">February has been a disappointing cycling month so far. Temperatures shot through the roof and it rained a lot.

<p>On Sunday, the mercury had climbed up again. While it stayed below zero, the Vantage helmet, the goggles, and thick gloves stayed at home this time.  I did the same loop as the day before with an extension to Plagne right at the start of the ride. And what an extension it was. Near the small hilltop village of Romont, I turned into a trail that was completely frozen for almost a mile. The rains and snowmelt created a large water reservoir at the end of the trail, and the trail had turned into a downright creek. When the temperatures dropped far below zero, that creek froze over entirely. I rode across it with my studded tires with a huge grin on my face.</p>

<p>By pure chance, I discovered a trail from the Stierenberg to the Grenchenberg that had been used by snowmobiles, and on Sunday observed multiple snowmobilers racing across the hills, which by the way is illegal in this country. I guess no one complains and no one checks because you can't hide snowmobile tracks crisscrossing the open hillsides in every direction. My feelings about that are somewhat mixed. As a fat-biker in a country where you just have to ride whatever is rideable in the winter, snowmobile tracks are super useful to travel through the winter world. On the other hand, these things burn fuel and with their speed and noise are problematic for the wildlife that needs to make it through the winter. There are ways to use them responsibly, but what I watched Sunday was anything but responsible.</p>

                    <p class="dropcap">Ever since I began fat-biking in March of 2013, I've been roaming across the area between Biel and the Chasseral. When the snow cover didn't reach town, I used to drive to Les Prés d'Orvin or Nods. Now that I live in Grenchen, that area is out of reach. Since Christmas, snow has remained at the foot of the mountains, making the drive to higher elevations unnecessary. Instead of driving to my old fat-bike playground, I've been exploring the mountain chain north of our house, and it's pretty spectacular.</p>

<p>Leaving home the ride starts with climbing 2'000 feet to reach a winter wonderland crisscrossed by countless snowshoe trails and groomed gravel roads that connect the numerous vacation homes along the top of the mountain. Some of the snowshoe trails are marked, and many are not. Once the sun drops low, it's time to return home. A beautiful, but at times risky downhill trail quickly destroys the 2'000 feet and spits me out into a fun labyrinth of trees. In the summer, it's easy to follow a footpath through those woods. In the winter, the most fun is not to get lost in the maze of trees, especially in the late afternoon when daylight is darkening. As long as the weather permits, I'll be fat-biking up there. It's a lot more convenient to start at the house without having to drive someplace.</p>

<p>We were lucky with them for the majority of their lives. They had an unlucky start into life and were quite sick when we adopted them, but up until early last year, they had never fallen ill. A pair of healthy cats don’t take much time. We used to feed them twice a day, they need a clean litterbox, various places to sleep, toys, and some playtime. When you’re on the couch it usually takes no time and a cat climbs onto your lap. If you try to provide some comfort of life for a chronically ill cat, however, a lot more of one’s time has to be given to your pet. My wife has done the brunt of the work and I basically halved my time riding. I still tried to head out regularly, but tremendously shorted the time out on a ride.</p>

<p>In a road cycling heavy May, I managed to cover 812 kilometers, but for the remainder of the year, my <a href="https://tinyurl.com/patrickstrahm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">monthly mileage totals</a> never climb back as high. In mid-April, my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-sl/">Volagi Viaje</a> received a new wheelset by <a href="https://www.blackcatwheels.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Cat Wheels</a> built with Kinlin TL-23 rims and Industry 9 Centerlock hubs. At the end of July, I sold my amazing Fortyfour Big Boy fat-bike; a bike with which I amassed 8’585 kilometers during 907 hours. In August, I gave my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-marauder/">44 Marauder</a> a <a href="https://offtrail.guru/another-cockpit-change/">cockpit upgrade</a> going from a Jones H-Bar Bend to a Ritchey Comp Kyote handlebar. Ultimately in September, I upgraded my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/">Nordest Albarda</a> to SRAM Red eTap AXS. My fat-bike season began with the first snowfall in the Jura on November 21st and continued all through December.</p>

<p>2021 will continue in the same fashion. Rides will remain short but hopefully regular. There’s an upgrade to my fat-bike I’ve been wanting to do, but for now, the parts are unavailable. My Albarda will be getting a 650B wheelset with Light-Bicycle <a href="https://www.lightbicycle.com/650b-road-bicycle-rims-32mm-wide-35mm-deep-symmetric-clincher-road-disc-brake-available.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WR35 carbon rims</a> and Chris King R45D hubs. At the end of spring or the beginning of summer, I would love to get my hands on a <a href="http://stoogecycles.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stooge</a> MK5. The trails up the hillside behind our house are too steep for a single-speed and riding it up the paved road just isn’t something I do. To fully take advantage of the trail network around our house I need a geared mountain bike with a rigid geometry to hit the steep descents. Without going custom, a Stooge MK5 looks perfect for just that.</p>

<p>I drove up to Les Prés d'Orvin on Saturday and returned once more on Sunday. With 30 centimeters of fresh snow, tire tracks dictated my loop on Saturday. On Sunday temperatures rose a little and the snow was heavier. My tires found a lot more grip. I climbed to the top of the ski slope. Gravity, after all, is strong enough to pull a fat-biker through deep, fresh powder. While far from being a fast descent, it's always a fun experience. At the bottom of the ski slope, I turned west to follow a winter hiking trail that had already been groomed. It would have been a good day to head out to the Chasseral and jump onto the snowshoe trail along the crest to return. But for that, I left too late. Speaking of snowshoeing, I think that this popular winter activity will experience more growth due to the pandemic this year. In previous years it usually took more time to have a rideable network of snowshoe trails.<br><br>Stats for the weekend: 47.1km ridden, 5h 54m in the saddle, 1'412m climbed. I may have to return this weekend. While rain is forecast for the lowlands, it should be snowing above 1'000m (3'300ft).</p>

<p>On Saturday's fat-bike ride, I was blown away by the amount of snow. The ground was frozen and fully covered in snow. Trees were white like in the deepest of winter. I stayed mostly off-trail to make my way to the Petit Chasseral, which I made my turnaround point. The legs felt good enough for more, but I didn't want to be out for even more time. I enjoyed the sunny weather and made my way back across the Place Centrale.<br><br>Sunday's fat-bike loop followed my traces left the day before for the most part. Due to the reduced amount of snow, I looped around the Petit Chasseral differently by climbing along the northern slope where the sun wasn't able to melt away the snow. Because I had started my ride past noon, I kept it shorter. All the slopes facing to the south were brown again and quite muddy, too. By the time I got to the car, the tires of my fatty were loaded up with a thick layer of mud. Thankfully, my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/">44 Snakedriver</a> always travels in bike jackets. They got a bit dirty, but my car didn't.<br><br>It was sweet to rediscover my Snakedriver after it's been sitting in the basement since the end of last winter. That bike puts a huge grin on my face. This will be the next bike to undergo a few upgrades. Now that Chris King is bringing gold back for 2021, it'll be time to replace the black T47 bottom bracket with a golden one. I would also love to replace the SRAM cranks with gold anodized Cane Creek titanium cranks. If they'd be available in 175mm length, I would have set things in motion already. Now I'm thinking of waiting until the bottom bracket is available to have a set of titanium cranks color-matched as well as possible.</p>

                <p class="dropcap">With every hobby there are things we love to do, things we have to do, things we can't do and yes, there are also things we simply won't do. There are a bunch of things I don't and won't do. In cycling, there's no right or wrong; some folks prefer one bike type over another, some live to bomb downhill, others rejoice in hitting hard climbs, some love to be rattled while others want squish. Ultimately it's about doing what's fun and we all achieve that in different ways. The way I roll is simply the way I roll.</p>

<h3>Don't #1 - Cycling Computer</h3>
<p>I had one in the early 90ies. It had a front-wheel sensor and you had to enter the diameter of your wheel to set it up. Then I rode without knowing numbers until <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/133569" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">joining Strava</a> in 2011. Despite Strava, a computer has never made it back onto the handlebar, though. My iPhone sits in a jersey pocket and records each ride. I don't want numbers to influence my ride. I deal with numbers all day long at work and don't want to see any while I ride.</p>
<h3>Don't #2 - Knobbies And Pavement</h3>
<p>This is a self-imposed don't. Knobby tires belong on dirt and not on pavement. When riding a mountain bike absolute priority is given to single-trails, gravel is permitted and pavement is avoided like the devil avoids holy water unless there's no rideable alternative. Taking the road to climb the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chasseral" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chasseral</a> on a mountain bike – heresy!</p>
<h3>Don't #3 - Suspension</h3>
<p>Just like every mountain biker who started riding in the 80ies, I mounted suspension forks to my bikes when they took off in the 90ies.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/35/merlin-mountain.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/35/responsive/merlin-mountain-xs.jpg 300w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/35/responsive/merlin-mountain-sm.jpg 480w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/35/responsive/merlin-mountain-md.jpg 768w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/35/responsive/merlin-mountain-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/35/responsive/merlin-mountain-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/35/responsive/merlin-mountain-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="Merlin MTB with an AMP suspension fork." width="2128" height="1595">
<figcaption >Kelso Dunes, Mojave Desert in the spring of 1995.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>But instead of following the trend and jumping on the full suspension bandwagon, I returned to rigid bikes at the turn of the century. I can proudly say that I've never owned a full suspension bike in 34 years of mountain biking and never will. Years ago I had the chance to test-ride a few. But none of them left me with the desire to actually own one. Rigid is how I roll, now and forever.</p>
<h3>Don't #4 - Strava Challenges</h3>
<p>Granted, they can be tremendously motivational for some cyclists to get out and ride. I don't participate in any because they'd only motivate me to squeeze the most miles out of my limited riding time. To rack up a ton of miles, it'd be stupid to fat-bike through the snow at 7-8 km/h when I could collect 3 to 4 times as many miles in the same time on the road. <a href="https://www.strava.com/challenges" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Challenges</a> would motivate me to do maximize mileage versus effort and that's absolutely not what I'm after on the bike.</p>
<h3>Don't #5 - Indoor Cycling</h3>
<p>Strava's activity feed is full of Zwift, Peloton, Sufferfest, and whatnot indoor cycling activities. Good for those who enjoy them. It's a workout and certainly beats doing nothing. I for my part don't plan on spending a dime on indoor equipment. I can't ride indoors and adding a huge monitor in front of a stationary bike to gamerize the boring task of pushing pedals and going nowhere won't change that. Turning pedals is a very small part of cycling. Keeping my balance, shifting my weight, touching the brakes, powering over obstacles, picking a line, lifting the wheels, birds chirping, leaves crunching, the wind howling, the sun setting, or snowflakes falling are far more important parts of a ride. Take these away – no can do!</p>
<h3>Don't #6 - Backpack</h3>
<p>Well, that's not a 100% don't. I've come to like my <a href="https://www.camelbak.com/en/vests/R01075--Chase_Bike_Vest" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Camelbak Chase Bike Vest</a>. And maybe that's the real secret about it; it's more vest and less backpack. It has a bladder to carry water during the part of the year when a water bottle cannot be refilled along the way. It holds a spare tube, my tools, my phone and has room for a GoPro or Osmo Pocket along with a short tripod. That's about it.</p>
<figure class="post__image post__image--center" ><img loading="lazy" src="https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/35/camelbak-chase-bike-vest.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px" srcset="https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/35/responsive/camelbak-chase-bike-vest-xs.jpg 300w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/35/responsive/camelbak-chase-bike-vest-sm.jpg 480w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/35/responsive/camelbak-chase-bike-vest-md.jpg 768w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/35/responsive/camelbak-chase-bike-vest-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/35/responsive/camelbak-chase-bike-vest-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/35/responsive/camelbak-chase-bike-vest-2xl.jpg 1600w"  alt="Camelbak Chase Bike Vest." width="3719" height="3651">
<figcaption >Camelbak Chase Bike Vest.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I see tons of mountain bikers riding with humongous backpacks. Every time I see one, I wonder what they can possibly carry in those. Are they having a little mountain top party with wine, a loaf of bread, and a fine cheese selection? Are they pedaling suicide bombers out looking for a large group of hikers to blow up? I'd have to empty my dresser and kitchen drawer to fill a backpack the size of what some folks strap to their backs. Anyway, I travel light, preferably with everything pushed into the pockets of my jersey, and keep having fun imagining the contents of the neon-colored balloons I see many bikers carry around.</p>
<h3>Don't #7 - Motorized Bike</h3>
<p>It's disappointing that an industry of a sport that is supposed to be healthy and eco-friendly is destroying that image by selling bikes that harm the environment from the day they're built to the day they're discarded. An e-bike that is ridden to and from work on the daily commute? Good, we all benefit when a couple thousand pounds and several hundred horsepower are replaced by a few dozen pounds and a few hundred watts. As an e-MTB purely ridden recreationally? Toxic waste attached to the down tube that will poison a landfill in a couple of years just to ride a little faster. Sorry, but no thanks! Can't we accept that our legs start to spin a little slower and with a bit less power as we age?</p>
<h3>Don't #8 - Ignore Traffic Rules</h3>
<p>I'm a cyclist but I'm also a driver and whether I'm sitting behind the steering wheel or behind a handlebar it pisses me off when cyclists blast through red lights or ignore stop signs. They don't just endanger themselves; they give the cycling community as a whole a bad reputation. Imagine if every road user would do that. It'd be the Wild West. Strangely though, some law-abiding weekday drivers immediately turn to law-breaking weekend warriors the minute they swing their legs over a bicycle. If you're not colorblind or mentally challenged and stop your car when the light is red, you should certainly be capable to do the same on a bike.</p>

<p>Sadly, we Westerners grew up with the luxury of being able to travel abroad several times a year, we're used to drive south on every extended weekend, we consume like no one else on the planet and drive anywhere, anytime for pure pleasure. Imagine if Africans, Indians, and the Chinese would live the same lifestyle. We would have lived ourselves into extinction already. Some of us stick the head in the sand and don't want to do anything about it. Others have a "devil-may-care" attitude and refuse to change their way of life. We could all do our part to improve things. The sum of small steps towards a better world can produce significant improvements if we all take some. Here's what I try to do:</p>
<h3>#1 - Fly Less</h3>
<p>The last long flight we took was to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157646194616746" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Norway in 2014</a>. We flew one more time to <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157677300361456" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">London in 2016</a>. While vacations half across the world may be tempting, it's a luxury our planet really can't handle.</p>
<h3>#2 - Drive Less</h3>
<p>We Europeans drive flipping way too much. Daily commutes, a concert there, a sports event there, an extended weekend to escape home - we're always burning fuel to go somewhere. As cyclists we seek fresh, clean mountain air, yet to do that we're strapping our bikes to the back of our car just as willing to pollute the air during the long drive to and from the Alps. I've never been someone to do that often. For one, an hour's drive to reach a bike destination in the mountains is a waste of my time. That's two hours I could be spending on the bike if I leave the car at home. So, to ride locally is a fairly easy adjustment for me to make. Those alpine sceneries do look nice, but I don't need to go there. I happen to live at the foot of the Swiss Jura. The atmosphere is a tiny bit cleaner if I stick to riding close to home.</p>
<h3>#3 - Consume Less</h3>
<p>Many of us earn enough money to buy almost anything we want. Apple releases a new iPhone? We want it. A brighter and larger TV than we bought last year? We want it. A bike that's stiffer, lighter, and faster than the one we bought last year? We buy it. Well, guess what? It may keep the wheels of our economy going, but it certainly won't keep the wheels of our planet going. I'm as guilty as anyone. What I try to do is lengthen the intervals at which items are replaced. My Mac Book was 7 years old when it died and I have yet to replace it. My iPhone SE is 4 years old. If I'm honest, my bikes could last longer than I've been using most. But everything I stop using is sold secondhand and someone else keeps happily using it.</p>
<h3>#4 - Consider What You Buy</h3>
<p>Bicycles used to be fairly simple pieces of equipment mainly built out of steel or aluminum. Generally, they lived a long life. Some of the mountain bikes we used to ride through the woods in the 90ies are still rolling around today; often as bikes for short commutes or little trips within town. And once they break, all the metal bits and pieces find their way into recycling. Carbon, which undoubtedly has made bikes better, unfortunately has a pretty bad environmental footprint. Both to produce and to discard. Now, the industry has completely thrown away its green label by flooding the market with e-bikes. I've had a few carbon bikes and still have carbon components, but I'm trying to reduce that. All my steel bikes are very capable bikes that are a pure joy to ride. Sure, they weigh more than an aluminum or carbon equivalent, but does it matter?</p>
<h3>#5 - Reuse, Resale, Recycle</h3>
<p>Some of my bikes of the past couple of years have been exercises of reusing components. My first Volagi Viaje was built with parts from my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/old-gravel-bikes/">Focus Mares CX 2.0</a>. The <a href="https://offtrail.guru/ritte-snob-disc/">Ritte Snob Disc</a> inherited many parts from my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/old-road-bikes/">Neilpryde Alize</a>. When first built, the <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/">Nordest Albarda</a> received the majority of the components that originally went from the red Volagi Viaje to the Ritte. Frames or bikes I stop using always find a new owner through Ebay. Components that are still good to use go the same way. Worn out stuff lands in the metal recycling bin. That way, parts have a long service life. Often with me and when not, with someone else.</p>

                <p class="dropcap">This weekend Europeans turned the clocks back an hour and perhaps for the last time. This would totally suck because I happen to like daylight saving time. If we're not going to change our clocks twice a year, I'd prefer the time to stay on DST all year round. Winston Churchill argued that daylight saving time enlarges "the opportunities for the pursuit of health and happiness among the millions of people” and I full-heartedly agree. DST is far better for my physical and psychological well-being. My "seven to five" work hours only allow me to be outdoors in the evening and it's a lot nicer and far safer to ride when it's still light outside. It's much harder to find the motivation to head out into the darkness with lights mounted to the bike. I love fat-bike night rides in the snow and occasionally do road rides at night, but having to do it for more than half the year would not be too much fun. Most likely, I'd be exercising far less. Wikipedia mentions several <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daylight_saving_time#Economic_effects" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">studies</a> that conclude that retailers, sporting goods makers, and other businesses benefit from extra afternoon sunlight. I spend a great deal on cycling equipment, clothing, and nutrition. On a wintertime schedule, those spending habits would undoubtedly be considerably smaller. Besides, that extra morning hour in the winter makes no difference. I leave home in the dark, whether the clock would happen to be on summer or wintertime.</p>
