                    <p class="dropcap">I started mountain biking in 1986 and road cycling in 1992. I don’t remember what saddles were on my first three mountain bikes. I sat on what the manufacturers specced for those bikes. In the early 90ies that changed with Selle Italia’s iconic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9ppbf3UeL0">Flite</a> saddle. It was a minimalist, long, slim saddle with a rounded top and a flexible hull. Equipped with titanium rails it made for a comfortable perch. It was a revolutionary saddle for the time, and I liked it a lot. Over the next decade, I stayed faithful to the brand and moved on to the even more minimalist, narrow-sided SLR. The SLR’s proﬁle ensured minimal pedaling interference, but to be honest, while it felt good with padded shorts or bibs, it was a horrible saddle to sit on without any padding.</p>

<p>In 2011 I switched brands. I rode <a href="https://www.fizik.com/eu_en/antares-r1.html">Fizik Antares</a> saddles in various models for the next eight years. There were R1, R3 with carbon braided rails or less expensive K:ium metal rails. My 44 Kid Dangerous 29er and my 44 Big Boy fat bike were given the top-of-the-line <a href="https://www.fizik.com/eu_en/antares-00.html">Antares 00</a>. An Antares VS was on my red Volagi, and an <a href="https://www.fizik.com/eu_en/antares-r1-versus-evo.html">R1 Versus EVO</a> still sits on top of my beige <a href="https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-sl/">Volagi</a>. When I rebuilt my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/ritte-snob-disc/">Ritte Snob Disc</a> road bike, I gave it the latest generation Antares 00. The Antares uses a generously proportioned rear and a relatively firm carbon-reinforced shell. Its flat shape meshes well with my anatomy and offers excellent long-distance comfort.</p>

<p>In 2019 the third saddle transition unfolded with the construction of my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/">Nordest Albarda</a>. After years of extra-long saddle designs, several manufacturers introduced saddles with a sawed-off nose. Prologo was one of them with the 245mm short Dimension. That’s 30mm shorter than the Fizik Antares saddles I was used to. The Prologo <a href="https://prologo.it/en/products/dimension-143">Dimension Nack</a> has a big pressure-relief channel, plenty of high-density padding, and a superbly comfortable, stepped nose. It was an immediate love affair. When it came to picking a saddle for my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/stooge-mk5/">Stooge MK5</a> rigid 27.5+ mountain bike, it was a no-brainer that the choice fell onto another short Prologo saddle.</p>

<p>Because I don’t find open-channel saddles practical for dirt or gravel riding, I selected the <a href="https://prologo.it/en/collections/marathon-xc/products/scratch-m5">Scratch M5</a> for the MK5. Prologo says that the rounded shape of the Scratch M5 allows the pelvis to rotate naturally. It favors the distribution of pressure over a larger surface area, creates stability, and supports the lumbar region. I’m not expert enough to confirm that, but my butt definitely likes sitting on it. My Marin Gestalt X12 will be equipped with the same Scratch M5, while both Fortyfours will say goodbye to the Antares 00 to welcome the latest of the Prologo saddle family, the <a href="https://prologo.it/en/collections/marathon-xc/products/scratch-ndr">Scratch NDR</a> with Nack rails. The ergonomic Scratch NDR is the off-road evolution of the Scratch M5 and is specifically designed for XC and marathon riding.</p>

                    <p class="dropcap">I now have three sets of Rotor aluminum Aldhu cranks, or four counting the carbon version on my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/ritte-snob-disc/">Ritte</a>.

The only thing I wish they would offer is Kapic axles for fat-bikes.</p>

<p>I had a SRAM XX1 fat-bike <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/32106663527" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crankset</a> that I had to throw into the trash because the axle was too worn. Well, I sold the drive-side crank for $21.50 on eBay. Only the non-drive side went into the trash bag. I will never buy a set again where one crank is permanently fixed to the axle. Modular cranksets such as Rotor or RaceFace can easily be moved to another bike. You simply buy a new axle if the new bike needs a wider or narrower one. And, if the bearing seats have developed too much wear after several years, you just buy a new axle for less than forty dollars. My <a href="https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/">Snakedriver</a> now has a pair of <a href="https://offtrail.guru/homework-done/">RaceFace Turbine</a> cranks for that reason.</p>

<p>For my upcoming project, code-named <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72177720304814362" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X12</a>, I’m using a pair of aluminum Aldhu cranks, which have been sitting in my spare parts cabinet for a couple of years. To find the ideal chain line for a 1x12 drivetrain, I purchased three different spiders as well as a standard and offset road axle. The axle not used for project X12 will likely end up on one of the other three bikes. While the 5-arm spider is my favorite, I am going to mount whatever results in the best chain line. I plan to use a Real World Cycling BSA30 bottom bracket for BB cups. It is a spare BB purchased for my Kid Dangerous in <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/9351279767" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2013</a>.</p>

<p>This is the first time I am mentioning <a href="https://www.strava.com/bikes/11999163" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project X12</a>. Project X12 is about challenging the tried and true. If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it - If something is reasonably successful or effective, there is no need to change or replace it. German speakers would say “<em>Bewährtes soll man nicht verändern</em>.” When it comes to cycling, most of us stick to that. We ride something, we like it, and we are therefore rarely willing to change it. Project X12 is an inexpensive platform to question everything I know. It may not be “the” answer, but it will certainly provide a ton of answers. And that, for now, is as much as I am saying about this endeavor.</p>

<p>With that positive experience, I bought three more items from a different vendor at the end of December. This time I filled my shopping cart with a long sleeve jersey, a jacket, and a vest with a thermal fleece for winter temperatures. All three are made by <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/store/5885239" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raudax</a>, a Chinese brand that sells its products primarily on AliExpress. Just like the three vests purchased in November, there is nothing to complain about. The zippers appear to be good quality, and the garments are neatly sewn. The fabrics feel great, and the fit is right. They are sized a bit large, but I generally wear two or even three layers underneath a jacket in the winter. So a relaxed fit is just what I need for the outermost layer of clothing. If the remainder of winter stays as warm as it has been, I will sadly not get a chance to wear them. And since I cannot travel, I cannot go where the snow is.</p>

<li>2023 Raudax Winter Cycling Thermal Fleece <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004948247790.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jacket</a> - CHF 16.94</li>

For 3” wide tires, they were light, coming in under 900 grams. They climbed and cornered well but had one shortfall. As a rear tire, the Nobby Nic performed poorly when braking in steep terrain. The tire broke loose too quickly. I rode into stuff a few times where I had to get off the bike to get down that segment of trail safely. I would have easily ridden it with a better tire. For my second season on the Stooge, I’ve opted to equip it with a more aggressive pair of tires.</p>

<p>Up front, I mounted the largest tire the steel fork can swallow, a Duro Crux at a whopping size of 3.25”. I popped on a 3.0” wide WTB Bridger in the back. In 2021, I bought four of these from <a href="https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chain Reaction Cycles</a> for $14.00 a piece. Both these tires weigh considerably more than the Nobby Nic. The WTB Bridger is a few millimeters narrower, but interestingly, it is a good centimeter taller than the German Schwalbe. Visually, it is easy to see that the bike now rolls on a lot more rubber than last year.</p>
<p>Because the bike industry abandoned 27.5+ tires in 2016, I stocked a bunch of tires for my Stooge. For the next few years, I have:</p>

<p>Most recently, I bought a bunch of cycling vests. Except for the summer months, I generally wear a vest over a short or long-sleeve jersey. During the winter, I also slip a vest over a winter jacket. It’s a piece of clothing I wear on most rides. A while back, I bought two camouflage-colored vests from <a href="https://www.primaleurope.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Primal</a>. I liked the combination of these camo prints with solid-colored jerseys and decided to look for others. I found three cool prints at the <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/store/5617285" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JoseMX</a> store on AliExpress. I wasn’t expecting quality for CHF 16.59 a piece, but I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. The fabric is nice, the stitching is well done, and the fit is perfect. One thing that would make these three vests even more useful, would be the use of a wind-breaking fabric for the front. Whenever windchill could be an issue, I certainly won’t be using them.</p>

</figure>
</div></div>
<p>Because of that, I bought two other vests from another AliExpress shop. These are wind-breakers. As far as material and workmanship there is nothing to complain. They’re well made. The manufacturer could improve them, though, by making the back pockets longer. I carry my phone, an iPhone 12 mini, and a tool pouch in these pockets, and my small iPhone sticks out of the side pockets. In comparison to other vests, the pockets could be 6-7 centimeters longer. Lastly, the shop sent one of the vests in a different color that didn’t match what I ordered. But at CHF 12.16 a piece, I’m not going to make a fuss about it.</p>

                    <p class="dropcap">Whenever you switch a part on your bike, it’s important to do your homework. A coworker of mine once wanted to change the stem on his bike. He got one, went on the put it on the bike, only to realize that his handlebar wouldn’t fit. He had purchased a stem with a 31.8mm clamp. Unfortunately, his bike was equipped with a 35mm handlebar. It’d be easy to laugh and say what a noob. But we can’t all be experts in everything. I’m certainly not. After several winters of riding <a href="https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/">my fat bike</a>, the axle of my crankset has worn where the bearings are seated. Without tightening the pre-load adjuster, there was noticeable play. A tightened pre-load adjuster doesn’t remove that play; it only hides it while the bike is in the work stand. The play is still there under every pedal stroke and will only worsen over time. It will also lead to premature bottom bracket failure. It was therefore time to replace the axle. Because I chose a <a href="https://www.sram.com/en/sram/models/fc-xx-1-c1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SRAM XX1 carbon crankset</a> at the time, a simple axle change isn’t possible. The axle and the non-drive side crank arm form an inseparable unit.</p>

The axle and the non-drive side crank arm form an inseparable unit.</p>

<p>So, I started to look for a new set of cranks. I would have loved to purchase a bling set of cranks with gold anodization. Leonardi offers their <a href="https://www.leonardiracing.com/en/crankset/11-5-capo-gold.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capo cranks</a> like that. Ignite Components has the <a href="https://www.ignitecomponents.com/product-page/catalyst-fatbike-cranks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Catalyst fat-bike cranks</a> that can be made in any color. Leonardi doesn’t currently offer fat-bike axles for their Capo cranks and Ignite only offers one Q-factor that is too narrow for my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/">Snakedriver</a>. So, I had to keep doing more homework. Homework is necessary for any crankset purchase no matter the type of bike. There are axle diameters, axle lengths, chain lines, Q-factor, and chain stay clearances to consider.</p>

<p>I immediately started looking at Race Face. Their Cinch-type cranksets come in a lot of flavors, and there’s a wide range of axles available. First, I looked if all the numbers would match up for the <a href="https://www.raceface.com/collections/cranks/products/next-sl-crankset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next SL</a> carbon cranks. But they didn’t. The numbers would have lined up for Race Face’s other carbon crank, the <a href="https://www.raceface.com/collections/cranks/products/next-r-crankset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Next R</a>. But this crank was a little busy on the logos. I never cared for the huge “XX” on my old SRAM cranks. I wanted something with no or at least small logos. It just happened that Race Face released a new <a href="https://www.raceface.com/collections/cranks/products/turbine-crankset" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Turbine</a> aluminum crankset in a modern remake of the legendary Turbine LP cranks (photos below). I studied the <a href="https://r2-bike.com/docs/race_face/turbine_2022_spezifikationen.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">drawing</a>, punched the numbers, and came to the conclusion that this was the perfect one. The Q-factor of 208mm with an RF169 spindle is 5mm wider than SRAM’s XX1 Eagle DUB SL crankset. The SRAM cranks were a little tight on my frame and only left 2-3mm clearance to the chain stays. 2.8mm more clearance felt right. The RF169 spindle is for fat bikes with 4” tires and a 170/177 rear axle. My <a href="https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/">Snakedriver</a>, however, runs 4.5” tires and is equipped with a 197mm wide rear hub. To get the chain line right, a Boost chainring with a 3-4mm offset needs to be flipped. The Cinch system, thankfully, lets you do that.</p>

<p>Speaking of flipping a Boost chainring, when it is oval, it’s also necessary to rotate it once flipped. I took a piece of paper, installed the chainring the way it is intended, drew the outline of the ring onto the paper, marked the direction of the crank, then flipped the ring and rotated it until it matched the outline on the paper. Lastly, it came to figuring out the right axle spacers and mounting them. Fortunately, I had plenty of 30mm axle spacers at various widths. I also had two different <a href="https://chrisking.com/products/threadfit-30-bottom-bracket-fit-kits" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris King BB fits kits</a> on hand. First, I popped in the plastic BB sleeves with the thicker shoulder and used a 6mm spacer on the drive side. This would have worked, although the drive-side crank was a little closer to the chain stay than the crank on the non-drive side. So, I exchanged the BB sleeves for the ones with the thin shoulder and corrected with a wider spacer. This equalized the clearance between the cranks and the chain stays. Lastly, I needed to find the right spacer to fill the gap on the non-drive side. A 2.5mm wide spacer did just that.</p>

<p>With an all-new drivetrain, the <a href="https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/">Snakedriver</a> is ready for winter if winter will show up. There are two more updates scheduled already. First, a <a href="https://bikerumor.com/prologo-adds-performance-xc-womens-and-ultralight-emtb-saddles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prologo Scratch NDR</a> saddle once it hits the store shelves. And secondly, a user-serviceable dropper post to replace the <a href="https://www.bikethomson.com/product/covert-dropper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thomson Covert</a> seat post. The <a href="https://www.wolftoothcomponents.com/products/resolve-dropper-post" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wolf Tooth Resolve</a> dropper post may be a contender.</p>

<p>With a <a href="https://www.smithoptics.com/en_US/p/helmet/forefront-2-mtb-helmet/FOREFRONT2-HELMET.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smith Forefront 2</a> for sunny winter days and a <a href="https://www.smithoptics.com/en_US/p/helmet/vantage-mens-snow-helmet/VANTAGE-HELMET.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smith Vantage</a> for freezing and windy conditions, I needed a good helmet for weather conditions in between. The Bern Brentwood fit right in there, although it wasn’t perfect. At the top, it had six openings that were entry points for snow on days with heavy snowfall. While I still wanted a helmet with vents, the ideal helmet would have none on top. I found just that with <a href="https://www.kask.com/en-us/cycling/moebius_24_97.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kask’s Moebius</a> urban helmet. Another interesting helmet in the same category is the <a href="https://www.specialized.com/us/en/tone/p/220797" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Specialized Tone</a>. I went with the Moebius because of its detachable visor and because it covers the back of one’s head more than the Tone. As far as design, the Specialized Tone certainly looks sleeker. In the case of the two, I picked function over form. Let’s not forget that my use case isn’t what the designers of those helmets had in mind when they drafted them on the drawing boards. Well, winter can come as far as I’m concerned.</p>

<p>I graduated from college during the economic recession in the early 1990s. Before the recession hit, recruiters were filling the main hall of our college at the end of the school year. When our class graduated, recruiters were nowhere to be seen. Companies were firing people and not looking for new graduates. I had a shiny new diploma in mechanical engineering, but the industry had no job for me. So, in 1993 I decided to spend the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72177720302209274" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">summer</a> working as a mountain bike guide for <a href="https://www.eurotrek.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurotrek</a>. They offered a one-week bike trip through the Swiss Jura and needed a guide for the season.</p>

<p>In 1994 I found some temporary employment in the medical industry. It was my first design job creating tools and medical implants in Unigraphics for one of the largest medical implant manufacturers at the time. It was a summer job while regular employees were on vacation. There was lots of work to get done, so they hired temps like me. The job was half across the country, and the company paid for lodging as well as meals. It was a pretty good salary, too. But as it was only for a few months, I decided to invest the money I had earned to improve my language skills and left for a 9-month language course in Oakland, California. Oakland? EF, who ran the language program, had many other locations in the US. To learn English best, I didn't want to be in a school with a bunch of other Swiss students. And Oakland wasn't a popular destination. At the time, most of them headed to Santa Barbara or San Diego. So I went to Oakland, where only four other Swiss students had enrolled in the extensive language program being offered by EF on the campus of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/sets/72177720302201485/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mills College</a>.</p>

<p>It’s kind of interesting to look back at such moments in life. I met a girl that year, and her mom met a Swiss national who owned a <a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-Contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business</a> in Northern California while she was selling books at a flea market in Sebastopol. He was looking for a Swiss engineer who would act as a liaison with the teams at the Swiss headquarters. I took the job, moved to Northern California for ten years, got married inbetween, and returned to Switzerland. Had I gone somewhere else, I would have met other people, and life would have turned out very differently. Maybe I would have never moved to the United States, maybe I would still be there, or maybe I’d be living somewhere else entirely. Spending hours scanning those old photos had me reflect on all that. Life is full of crossroads, and a different life awaits in every direction. Crossroads of life have one thing not in common with physical intersections; they don’t carry street signs. Left, right, straight ahead - all would lead onto a whole different path. Better or worse? We, fortunately, will never know.</p>

<p>Anyway, as a cyclist, it was no question that I would bring <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/52368731834" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my bike</a> along. I could have bought one over there, but I had a tight budget, and my savings needed to last ten months. I was busy traveling around the state with classmates most of the time. When spring break came along, my friends couldn’t decide what they wanted to do. I tossed my bike into the trunk of my car and took off for Moab, Utah, where I spent the week riding daily. I had bought a used <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/52368782513" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Plymouth Gran Fury</a> for about $4000, and a mountain bike easily fit into the massive trunk. When I was done with a ride, I hiked Arches National park in the afternoons. Returning to school with <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/sets/72177720302212137/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">photos</a> of riding and hiking around Moab convinced a close friend of mine to head out there with me one more time. During our visit to Moab, we booked a guided bike week with <a href="https://westernspirit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Western Spirt Cycling</a> through the Maze District of the Canyonlands National Park.

                    <p class="dropcap">Most of my cycling photos taken during the past six years have been shot with a GoPro Hero 5 Session in video mode. When I want to snap a picture of myself riding a particular spot on a trail or capture the scenery along a particular route, I place the <a href="https://gopro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GoPro</a> on the ground, press the record button, hop on the bike, ride away from the camera, turn around and ride back towards the camera. I have an extendable mini-tripod that is small enough to fit into a jersey pocket and a longer one that needs to go into a backpack or a jersey pocket if I wear a vest over it. Shooting that way takes all but a few minutes, and the video footage the GoPro recorded is often not more than a minute and a half. At home, I view the video footage on my MacBook Pro in <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VLC</a> and export the snapshots I want. Then, those unedited snapshots are imported into <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/photos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photos</a>, where I crop and color-adjust them.</p>

<p>The GoPro Hero 5 Session has been the perfect tool for it. I bought a <a href="https://www.dji.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DJI</a> Osmo Pocket in 2019, and while it’s a nice piece of equipment, it didn’t replace the small, cubic GoPro. By action camera standards, the Hero 5 Session is ancient now, and I’ve kept an eye on the market for a replacement that does the job better while remaining as small in size. In November 2021, DJI released just such a compact camera, the <a href="https://www.dji.com/ch/dji-action-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Action 2</a> camera. It’s a magnetic action camera consisting of a camera unit with either a front touchscreen or a power module. As always, with equipment like this, I’m never first in line to buy it. I wait for reviews to come in and then wait some more until demand drops and the manufacturer decides to drop the price. Swiss comparison website <a href="https://www.toppreise.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Toppreise.ch</a> has a nifty price monitoring tool that can send you an alert if the price drops below a value you set. In early July, I got such an alert because DJI dropped the price to its lowest price yet. So, I pulled the trigger on the Power Combo for CHF 289.00, shipping included.</p>
<figure class="post__image"><img decoding="async" loading="lazy"  src="https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/64/dji.action2.power.combo.png" alt="Price development of the DJI Action 2 Power Combo." width="971" height="549" sizes="100vw" srcset="https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/64/responsive/dji.action2.power.combo-xs.webp 300w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/64/responsive/dji.action2.power.combo-sm.webp 480w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/64/responsive/dji.action2.power.combo-md.webp 768w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/64/responsive/dji.action2.power.combo-lg.webp 1024w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/64/responsive/dji.action2.power.combo-xl.webp 1360w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/64/responsive/dji.action2.power.combo-2xl.webp 1600w"></figure>
<p>Action cameras by GoPro, DJI, <a href="https://www.insta360.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insta360</a>, or others are designed as portable POV cameras to capture your adventures on a bike, on skis, in a kayak, or any other outdoor sport. But let's be honest, if you're not a paid madman jumping across canyons at <a href="https://www.redbull.com/int-en/events/rampage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redbull Rampage</a> and video-editing isn’t a talent of yours, most POV videos won’t generate much more than a yawn if anyone spares a few minutes to watch them. When I had my first few action cameras, I stitched together a dozen Youtube videos. A handful garnered a respectable number of views, but most did not. To produce anything worth watching, one has to spend a big chunk of time filming and an even bigger chunk of time editing. Since I neither have the time nor the drive to spend hours on video production, I've used my action cameras almost solely to capture myself riding short trail segments and extracting the best photo from the short video clips. It is something that doesn’t require a lot of time, either during the ride or afterward on the computer at home. Okay, an action cam use case may be to create short video clips for <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok</a> or <a href="https://www.instagram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reels</a>, but I'm honestly too old for that.</p>

For the last two years, I wasn’t able to mountain bike as much. Now that I have spent more time on trails again, something strange has been happening with regular frequency. Hikers comment about the fact that I’m riding with my muscle-power only. I have been mountain biking since the mid-eighties, and while I rarely had a negative encounter with a hiker, most of the time I met a hiker, we briefly exchanged a quick "hello" or "good day." That was usually it. Now, I’m regularly applauded for riding without the assistance of a motor. Yesterday, for instance, someone remarked: “Oh great, someone still riding a real bike!”</p>

<p>It left a grin on my face for the rest of an extremely tough climb. A real bike. So, in the eyes of that hiker, an eBike isn’t a real bike. It still has me thinking. Much may have to do with the fact that a human-powered mountain biker isn’t much faster than a hiker when a trail points upwards. An eBiker, by contrast, flies by with a greatly elevated speed. I don’t know what is going on here. I only observe that hikers have become much friendlier to a human-powered biker like myself ever since they have to share the trails with motorized bikes.</p>

<p><a href="https://offtrail.guru">Offtrail.guru</a> isn’t getting updated as frequently as I would like to, but sometimes there are other priorities in life. That’s just how it is. If I have more time to ride, shoot photos, and share them here, I’d like to bring a drone along on my cycling adventures again. I got my feet wet with <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/tags/drone" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one</a> in 2017. In those five years, drones have become a whole lot better and a whole lot more reliable. But as long as I can’t dedicate any time to such a high-tech toy, I’ll keep following the drone market without actually pulling out my wallet to get one.</p>
