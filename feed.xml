                    <p class="dropcap">When I first got into cycling in the mid-80s, entry-, mid-level, and high-end bikes were not tremendously far apart. Mountain bikes had no suspension, and frames were made from steel or aluminum. Groupsets were the primary difference between bikes. An entry-level bike had Shimano LX, a mid-level bike was equipped with DX, and a top-of-the-line bike came with XT. I started on an entry-level bike, moved to a mid-level Specialized Stumpjumper, and soon rode a World-Cup-level Muddy Fox with a full Shimano XT groupset. Even seat posts were part of such groupsets back then. XT came with a nice black steel seat post. You read that right: a seat post made out of steel. A few years later, I spent a small fortune owning a Merlin Titanium with XTR derailleurs and many boutique components. For much of my cycling career, I bought or built nice bikes that cost a lot. They were never outrageously expensive, but more than I needed.</p>

<p>Now that I'm in my mid-50s, I've gotten wiser. I have a <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/">Nordest Albarda</a> with SRAM Red XPLR AXS and a <a href="https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12/">Marin Gestalt</a> X with equivalent Rival components. There is no functional difference between the two. Red looks a little different and is a bit lighter. That's it for twice the price. I paid EUR 699.00 for a <a href="https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-sl/">Volagi Viaje</a> frameset and CHF 1'600.00 for a complete Marin Gestalt X10. I built two of my best road/gravel bikes with those. I see no need to spend an arm and a leg on a carbon bike. They may offer improved aerodynamics, light weight, maximum stiffness, a few watts, and ultimate performance. Does it matter to a rider like myself? For a professional cyclist who aims to win the Tour, every marginal gain counts. However, for the average Joe like myself, shedding a few pounds of belly fat will have a much greater impact than investing thousands of dollars in a UCI-approved race bike.</p>

<p>The bike industry is in crisis. Warehouses are filled with unsold bikes. Despite heavily discounted prices for new bikes, there is no demand. BMC has recently <a href="https://road.cc/content/news/bmc-applies-cut-hours-its-remaining-staff-306681">requested</a> state wage subsidies. Many others are struggling, with some even having filed for <a href="https://www.bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2023/02/09/parlee-cycles-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bankruptcy</a>. While there are multiple factors contributing to this situation, bike prices are certainly a major issue. Charging over $8000 for carbon bikes with integrated cable routing? Sorry, but no thanks. The road bikes I ride cost less than half of that. They do the job, and they do it well. The development of hiding brake hoses and shifter cables inside the handlebar, stem, and fork over the past couple of years has undoubtedly created some clean-looking bikes. However, I don’t particularly like the massive stems and spacers that come along with it, especially on top of a steel or titanium frame. The clean look was achieved at the expense of ease of maintenance and adjustability. Changing a stem or cleaning the internals of a headset are jobs that can easily be done in under half an hour. On a fully integrated bike, such a simple job now requires several hours. As a bike mechanic, such a bike will never be the bike of my dreams but rather the bike of my nightmares.</p>

<p>Although it may not be the conventional choice for a road bike, my Marin Gestalt X12 is the best one I have built. If I could have any bike, it would be a titanium replica of it. It would not offer any performance improvement compared to the aluminum version. It would only cost a lot more and be cool. And sometimes, it's all right to slaughter one's piggy bank to realize cool things. These past couple of years, I have found a new challenge, though. It is to build awesome bikes on a reasonable budget. It is easy to put together a jaw-droppingly cool bike on a large budget. It takes more time to plan, search, and compare to do the same on a limited budget. With the cost of living on the rise and my retirement approaching, I will likely opt for bikes that simply do the job. Dream bikes will be the things to drool over on Instagram.</p>

<p>On the 20th, I had to catsit all day and worked on my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/">Nordest Albarda</a>. The bike received the <a href="https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12-on-new-wheels/">new 700C wheels</a> and seatpost from my Marin. I also exchanged the Zipp Service Course SL stem. An older gloss-black one made room for a new one in matte-black. I also installed new rotors - the <a href="https://bucklos.co/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bucklos</a> Centerlock rotors I mentioned in my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/centerlock-rotor-comparison/">previous post</a>. I am stoked about the result. The bike went through several <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda-2021-update/">iterations</a> since 2019, and this is the best one yet. On Sunday, I had to do something about my cabin fever. I drove to Prés d’Orvin before sunrise to fat-bike the snow-covered mountains. It was an <a href="https://www.strava.com/activities/10600090821" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">epic morning</a>. I did not see another human being for several hours. I had that icy winter wonderland all to myself. A bluish sky to the north and a cloudy one to the south created some unreal colors.</p>

</div></div>
<p>Utilizing my expertise in reading snow, intimate knowledge of the terrain, and keen awareness of how the wind shapes, moves, and hardens the large snow surfaces to the north of the peak, I navigated my way to the Chasseral. This is the ultimate essence of fat-biking for me. It is not sufficient to just be a skilled mountain biker who studies GPS tracks, elevation profiles, and maps to fully enjoy fat-biking in a country that has never fully embraced the sport. Understanding how the winter alters the local environment is crucial. This element of the sport is something you don’t need on the road, on gravel, or dirt. However, it is a huge part of what makes fat-biking so addictive.</p>

<p>I have stopped doing <a href="https://offtrail.guru/year-2020-in-review/">end-of-year</a> reviews. There just aren’t any epic adventures to look back to since I cannot venture beyond my local area to explore new trails or roads. While I used to go on 56-57 fat-bike rides <a href="https://offtrail.guru/ride-type-statistics/">annually</a> from 2017 to 2019, I have only done three snow rides in 2023. The difference? I used to be able to load my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/tags/fat-biking/">fat bike</a> into the car and drive 10-30 minutes to trailheads at higher elevations. In terms of the total number of rides I took in 2023, I only managed 100, which is a far cry from my peak between <a href="https://offtrail.guru/annual-stats-by-month/">2016 and 2018</a>, when I averaged 165 rides per year. Out of those 100 rides, 72 were on pavement, sometimes with a bit of gravel mixed in. My annual ride distance and time have reached an all-time low, with only 3,147 kilometers and 193 hours, compared to my peak in 2018 when I rode 8,752 kilometers and spent a staggering 586 hours in the saddle. My goal for the years ahead is to gradually get back to that level, maybe as early as 2026.</p>

Many of the garage or basement shop setups that people share online are sometimes more spacious and better equipped than your local bike store. You don’t need that.</p>

<p>I never had the luxury of owning a large enough house in which I could set up a permanent workshop. In the small townhouse, I rented in the US, I wrenched on my bikes outside on the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/250774966" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">porch</a>. We have a spacious basement in the house that we are renting now. The room houses a laundry machine, a dryer, as well as a hot water boiler. I store my bikes on racks to the left and right side of that boiler. The center area is our laundry space. We filled the front third with metal shelves and wine racks along the walls. It offers plenty of space for me to work on bikes whenever necessary. I covered that area with carpet to avoid staining the basement floor. I do much of the bike maintenance either sitting on an old step stool or sitting on the floor.</p>

<p>If I had enough space, would I set up a bike workshop with a sturdy workbench and pegboards? A well-organized workspace makes servicing bikes easier and more efficient. Efficiency is important to a bike shop mechanic. Nevertheless, for a weekend warrior like myself, does it matter if it takes 15 minutes to bleed the brakes or half an hour? I own way too much stuff already, so I would not want to accumulate yet more stuff to create a workspace that I would only use once a week, if not less frequently. During my singlehood, I did not own a TV. I had very few possessions. Once you are married, stuff quickly accumulates. Stuff can also easily start to pile up with a hobby like cycling. I have made it a habit not to hold onto old components. I sell them through classified ads on <a href="https://www.anibis.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anibis</a> or place them on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eBay</a>. Currently, I have too many bikes, and I plan to reduce the number in the coming years by avoiding replacements. There are certain tasks that I am unable to do using the tools in my small bike toolbox because they require specialized and often prohibitively expensive tools that are just silly for a weekend hobbyist to own. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>facing and reaming head tubes</li>
<li>pressing in headsets</li>
<li>chasing and facing bottom bracket shells</li>
<li>lacing and truing wheels</li>
</ul>
<p>For this, I rely on my <a href="https://www.47grad-nord.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">local bike shop</a>. They have the proper professional tools and can do this far better and far more efficiently than I ever could.</p>

<p><u><i>Off-topic</i></u>: I have been lusting after a new frameset for a couple of months. The manufacturer had already created the product page for the 2024 model but made those pages unavailable to general website visitors. Somehow, however, Google's search engine crawler managed to index it. I stumbled upon it while doing an image search. I liked the bike in its previous iterations and absolutely love the <a href="https://www.marinbikes.com/bikes/2024-headlands-frame-kit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">colors</a> they picked for 2024. Since I have reached my “N+1” limit, currently <strong>seven</strong>, I thought about sending my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/">Nordest Albarda</a> frame into temporary retirement and using its components to build the new bike. I changed my mind. The Nordest Albarda, with its recent 1x12 <a href="https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda-2023-update/">update</a>, is still a sweet-looking bike. With the additional AR25 wheels, I now have a total of four wheelsets that can be mounted to either the MGX12 or the Nordest. Now that the Nordest no longer has a front derailleur, I can mount larger 700C tires. The limit of the frame is probably 48mm. The fork, surprisingly, can accept a 55mm Antelope Hill. I will keep a sharp eye on that frame kit, however. If an online retailer has my size and massively drops the price at the end of the season, I might swoop one up.</p>

<p><u><i>Tool-topic</i></u>: To install the Hope Centerlock lockring on the rear hub, the black thru-axle end cap needs to be removed. Unlike many other hubs, the end cap can be taken off and installed while the brake rotor and lockring are in place. However, it can be quite challenging to remove the end cap with just two fingers, and there is nothing for a tool to safely grip onto. To solve this problem, I purchased a Wheels Manufacturing <a href="https://wheelsmfg.com/presses-tools/bearing-extractors/6001-6801-6901-12mm-sealed-bearing-extractor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">12mm bearing extractor</a>, which can grab the end cap from the inside. It is extremely simple to pull the end cap off with such an extractor. I should have bought one a long time ago.</p>

                    <p class="dropcap">In November, I got a new <a href="https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12-on-new-wheels/">wheelset</a> for my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12/">Marin Gestalt X12</a>. Before that, it was using seven-year-old Nox Composites <a href="https://www.noxcomposites.com/citico" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Citico</a> wheels with Chris King R45D hubs. The new wheels had Hope Pro5 Centerlock hubs, Light Bicycle <a href="https://www.lightbicycle.com/700C-gravel-bicycle-rims-40mm-wide-44mm-deep-aero-clincher.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WG44</a> rims, and René Herse <a href="https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/700c/700cx55-antelope-hill-tc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antelope Hill</a> tires. I enjoy climbing on my bikes and also like to descend. The new wheels were great for climbing, fast on flat surfaces, and smooth on gravel. However, they were not perfect for descending. Specifically, when I exceed 50 kph with head and crosswinds on open descents that are not too steep, the steering becomes wobbly and insecure.</p>

                <p class="dropcap">In November, I got a new <a href="https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12-on-new-wheels/">wheelset</a> for my <a href="https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12/">Marin Gestalt X12</a>. Before that, it was using seven-year-old Nox Composites <a href="https://www.noxcomposites.com/citico" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Citico</a> wheels with Chris King R45D hubs. The new wheels had Hope Pro5 Centerlock hubs, Light Bicycle <a href="https://www.lightbicycle.com/700C-gravel-bicycle-rims-40mm-wide-44mm-deep-aero-clincher.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WG44</a> rims, and René Herse <a href="https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/700c/700cx55-antelope-hill-tc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antelope Hill</a> tires. I enjoy climbing on my bikes and also like to descend. The new wheels were great for climbing, fast on flat surfaces, and smooth on gravel. However, they were not perfect for descending. Specifically, when I exceed 50 kph with head and crosswinds on open descents that are not too steep, the steering becomes wobbly and insecure.</p>

<p>At slower speeds or steeper descents, the instability is not present. There are two possible causes for this. Firstly, the 55mm wide Antelope Hill tires and the 40mm tall WG44 rims create a large surface area, making the front wheel more susceptible to wind gusts. Secondly, the <a href="https://bikeinsights.com/bike-geometries/636a376a032291001d24e0b4-2023-marin-bikes-gestalt-x10-base-l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slack geometry</a> of the Gestalt X12 could be a factor. The long front triangle and slack head tube angle move the front wheel further from the rider, changing the weight distribution and putting less weight on the front wheel. This might explain why the bike descends well on steeper roads as more of my weight shifts forward. I want a bike to feel sharp and precise, so I have some testing to do.</p>
<h4>Test #1 - New wheels with 44mm Snoqualmie Pass tires</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wheels</span>: Hope Pro5 Centerlock thru-axle hubs, Light Bicycle WG44 high-profile rims, René Herse 700C x 44 Snoqualmie Pass tires</p>

<p>This setup feels incredible. The bike is a nimble climber, an agile descender, and quick on flats, too. The smaller tires require more air pressure, about 2.8 bars (40 psi). They are still comfortable but don’t offer the smoothness of a 55mm tire. They are noticeably faster than their larger siblings on gravel. They look and feel very aerodynamic. The front wheel cuts through the air like a hand-forged Katana, and the steering is as sharp as one. I'm glad about that. At least I have not built the wrong wheelset.</p>
<h4>Test #2 - Old wheels with 55mm Antelope Hill tires</h4>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Wheels</span>: Chris King R45D Centerlock thru-axle hubs, Nox Composites Citico low-profile rims, René Herse 700C x 55 Antelope Hill tires</p>

<p>The Antelope Hill tire is the tire I would like to use on this bike. I would go down one size to the 700C x 48 <a href="https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/700c/700c-x-48-hatcher-pass-tc-tire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hatcher Pass</a>, but I wouldn't go any smaller. The 55mm tires, paired with low-profile rims, are borderline criminal. They don't hold me back while climbing and offer a crazy amount of grip on the descents. I rode this setup on the descent, where the tires on the WG44 rims felt awful. I also took this setup to the ultimate descent from my Hausberg, the Grenchenberg. This is a pothole-covered, rock-littered, and bumpy downhill. The bigger the tires, the faster this road can be ridden. Needless to say, the Antelope Hill tires are made for such terrain.</p>
<h4>Conclusion - Large tires on high-profile rims are not for the MGX12</h4>
<p>A new wheelset with low-profile rims is necessary. The Nox wheels would do the job, but they are seven years old and now serve as spare wheels. I often mount knobbier tires on them and use them during the winter months.</p>

<p>There were two Light Bicycle rims I was considering: the <a href="https://www.lightbicycle.com/AR25-Disc-Carbon-Gravel-Bike-Rim-700c-24mm-Wide-25mm-Deep.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AR25</a> gravel rim and the <a href="https://www.lightbicycle.com/xc930-super-light-xc-carbon-rim-270g-tubeless-ready.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XC930</a> cross-country rim. The Light Bicycle AR25 rim has a depth of only 25mm and weighs 250g with an inner width of 24mm. That’s an impressive weight. The XC930 is only 22mm tall, weighs only 270g, and is as wide as the WG44, 30mm. Being an MTB rim, it is only available hookless. This makes them only suitable for high-volume and low-pressure tires, limiting their potential use. The AR25, as the lightest 700C gravel rim that Light Bicycle has developed, would be much more versatile. It has a hybrid hook bead, which allows for higher tire pressures and can be used for a wide range of tire widths (28-50). My wheels often move from one bike to another. The AR25 is the better choice for that. A pair of AR25 rims come with a weight saving of 260g against the Citico and a whopping 400g savings against the WG44.</p>

                <p class="dropcap">When it comes to cycling clothing, it should be stylish, comfortable, and practical, all while being reasonably priced.

<p>However, the future of several online bike retailers is uncertain. When the pandemic hit, factories in the Far East closed, sea ports slowed operations, and the entire supply chain collapsed. People were sent to home office, were no longer able to go to the gym or yoga class, and suddenly discovered cycling. Bike stores, both online and physical, struggled to keep up with the surging demand for bikes and parts. The bike industry collectively saw the post-pandemic years through rose-tinted glasses. They cranked up production and filled inventories. When inflation rose, prices climbed while real wages dropped. Cyclists, both new and seasoned, are feeling the pinch and have not returned to the shops. As 2023 draws to a close, inventories are overflowing with unwanted merchandise, and the industry is offering massive discounts to stay afloat.</p>

<p>Wiggle, Chain Reaction Cycles, Probikeshop, Bikester, and Fahrrad.de have had another wrench thrown into their spokes. They are all part of an umbrella company called Internetstores GmbH. Internetstores GmbH is the European subsidiary of Signa Sport United, which <a href="https://www.pinkbike.com/news/signa-sports-uniteds-internetstores-gmbh-declares-insolvency.html">recently filed</a> for bankruptcy. Signa Sports United, in turn, is part of Signa Holding, a debt-ridden Austrian property empire that is unraveling as we speak. As a result of the turmoil, WiggleCRC has <a href="https://www.pinkbike.com/news/wiggle-and-crc-to-close-international-web-shops-as-sales-process-gathers-pace.html">announced</a> that its international e-commerce platforms, which only made up 15% of the business’s revenue, will be shutting down in the coming weeks to focus their efforts solely on the UK market. This means I will no longer be able to shop there.</p>

<p>Last year, I <a href="https://offtrail.guru/shopping-on-aliexpress/">began</a> browsing for <a href="https://offtrail.guru/raudax-cycling-clothing/">cycling apparel</a> on <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/">AliExpress</a>. During the autumn season, I revisited the website to search for cycling jackets, long-sleeved jerseys, vests, and bib shorts. I found two brands, <a href="https://spexcel.aliexpress.com/store/2219030">Spexcel</a> from Shenzhen and <a href="https://mykilometres.aliexpress.com/store/912228023">My Kilometre Sports</a> from Wuhan, China, that offer up-to-date designs and high-quality materials. Both brands have their own online stores on AliExpress. I purchased several windproof vests from <a href="https://spexcel.cc/">Spexcel</a> that are perfect for chilly rides. The vests are made with advanced materials and clever construction. The same can be said about their bib shorts, which provide a lot of value for the price. The long-sleeved jerseys from <a href="https://www.mykilometresports.com/">My Kilometre Sports</a> are equally impressive, with stylish cuts, excellent craftsmanship, and meticulous attention to detail.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, I receive a DM on Instagram from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/epnsupplements/">@EPNsupplements</a> with an offer to become a sponsored athlete. With my measly <a href="https://www.instagram.com/patrickstrahm/followers/">305</a> followers, I guess my circle of influence is large enough to qualify as an ambassador for supplements. What the heck do I need supplements for? It’s not like I have ever switched on my coffee maker in the morning, still half-asleep, with the thought that I needed to supplement my cup of Joe with a dose of multivitamins. And when I am out on a long bike ride, my stomach has never screamed out for a silly protein powder. I do, however, often look forward to a cold, post-ride beer. <a href="https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/cultivating-health/the-truth-about-supplements-for-athletes-and-whether-you-should-be-using-them/2023/05">Research</a> on exercise supplements shows that these products are a useless waste of money and can be potentially toxic to your body. Such supplements only do one thing: fill the pockets of those who sell them.</p>

<p>How wide is too wide? I wonder about this question and hope to find the answer on the next leg of my journey. Wide tires fit best on wide rims, so the new wheels use 30mm internal <a href="https://www.lightbicycle.com/700C-gravel-bicycle-rims-40mm-wide-44mm-deep-aero-clincher.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WG44 carbon rims</a> by Light Bicycle. They will securely hook René Herse <a href="https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/700c/700cx55-antelope-hill-tc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Antelope Hill</a> (700x55) tires. Tubeless, of course. Light Bicycle used a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/870363693078977/posts/our-new-hybrid-hook-design-aims-to-improve-tire-fitment-even-further-when-the-hy/5659842387464393/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hybrid hook design</a> to improve tire fitment for the WG44 rims. Hookless rims combined with supple tires are an absolute no-go for me. You may be wondering why anyone would ride so much rubber on pavement. Because it’s fun and because it’s fast. Fast? You gotta be kidding. Granted, you may not be winning any KOMs going uphill. But you stand a good chance of grabbing every KOM going downhill. And you’ll do it with confidence and a huge smile on your face. But speed isn’t as much on my mind these days. I’m after grip, security, all-day comfort, and pure fun and pleasure. If 55mm turns out to be too much, I can go back to 44mm or pick a <a href="https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/700c/700c-x-48-hatcher-pass-tc-tire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hatcher Pass</a> 48mm in between.</p>

<p>I generally pick the Rolls-Royce of bicycle hubs, Chris King, for the kernel of my wheels. I have two wheelsets with <a href="https://chrisking.com/collections/r45d-centerlock" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">R45D Centerlock</a> hubs. On the roadside of things, I also own two wheelsets with <a href="https://industrynine.com/hubs/road_disc/classic-road-disc-cl-rear/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Industry 9 Torch</a> hubs. Centerlock, as well. Much more important than the brand, though, is versatility. Bike hubs need to be adaptable and should best be somewhat future-proof. You should always be able to change them from QR to through-axle or vice versa with just a few parts. You should also be able to pick a Shimano HG, SRAM XD/R, or MicroSpline freehub body without needing a new wheel. If hubs don’t offer such flexibility, I don’t buy them.</p>

<p>For the <a href="https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12/">MGX12</a>, however, I didn’t want to shell out a big chunk of cash for Chris King. They're amazing hubs with an unmatched quality, but they leave a big hole in one's wallet. Instead, I opted for more affordable and extremely versatile <a href="https://www.hopetech.com/news/the-all-new-pro-5-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hope Pro 5</a> hubs. They’re available with all modern freehub bodies and end spacers to suit different frame and axle standards. They're also offered in six anodizations. So, exactly what I want from a pair of hubs. As always, the wheels were masterfully laced by Patrik at <a href="https://www.47grad-nord.ch/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">47º Nord</a>.</p>

<p>I had a very clear idea of how I was going to convert the Nordest Albarda to 1x12. Things were a bit fuzzy with the Viaje. Initially, I thought about using the same setup as on the <a href="https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12/">Marin Gestalt X12</a>, SRAM Rival AXS XPLR. Then, I noticed that I could get the recently released Force AXS XPLR for only a little bit more money. But I’m using neither of the two. I stumbled upon Garbaruk’s <a href="https://www.garbaruk.com/sram-12-speed-axs-rd-cage.html?category=25" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cage kit</a> for SRAM AXS road derailleurs. And I removed just such a derailleur from my Nordest. The most cost-effective way to bring the Viaje into the 1x12 era is to use the SRAM Red AXS derailleur I already have, replace its cage, and buy a pair of Rival AXS shift/brake levers. They’re inexpensive, and their stealth black finish looks cool, too. The Garbaruk cage is black with red pulleys to match the bike’s color scheme.</p>

<p>Some cyclists replace their bikes every year and never bother to change much. They may replace tires, brake pads, chains, and maybe even a cassette. Besides that, a new setup only comes with a new bike. I prefer to hold onto a bike if it’s fun. I also enjoy to keep tuning it. Sometimes, the job at hand is only about replacing old and/or worn parts. Other times, it’s about changing fit and function altogether. The complex interaction between a bike and me depends largely on my own variability. As I’m aging, my physical capabilities are the largest factor in that intricate person-machine relationship. A bike setup that felt right just a few years ago may no longer be right today. Upgrading the machine is, therefore, often about keeping the machinist smile.</p>

<p>My human motor was more finely tuned and performed best when matched to a 2x drivetrain with a tightly spaced cassette just a few years ago. Thanks to the latest addition to my bike stable, the <a href="https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12/">Marin Gestalt X12</a>, I discovered that my 54-year-old diesel engine runs quite smoothly when allowed to power a simple 1x12 drivetrain. I love simplification. Getting rid of the front derailleur has lots of benefits. It’s one less battery to keep charged. From a mechanical point of view, a front derailleur is a pretty crude method to move a chain from one chainring to the other. It causes both the chain and the chainrings to wear out faster. Also, I rarely use the smallest three cogs in the big ring (48T). With a 1x12 drivetrain, on the other hand, every cog gets its fair share of work. So, the time has come to match the Nordest Albarda to the preferences of this new old guy.</p>

<p>Starting in the fall of 2023, it’s equipped with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Crankbrothers Eggbeater 3 pedals</li>
<li>Easton EC70 SL 31.8mm, 440mm carbon handlebar</li>
<li>Fouriers 31.8mm seat post clamp</li>
<li>Rotor Aldhu 5-bolt 110BCD spider</li>
<li>Rotor Aldhu standard 30mm road axle</li>
<li>SRAM Force FlatTop chain</li>
<li>SRAM Red XPLR AXS rear derailleur</li>
<li>SRAM XPLR XG-1251 10-44T cassette</li>
<li>Wheels Manufacturing BSA-68/73-30 bottom bracket</li>
<li>Wolf Tooth 42T oval chainring</li>
<li>Wolf Tooth 6mm chainring bolts</li>
</ul>
<p>That said, there’s a chance I’m sending the Nordest Albarda frameset into temporary retirement and move all its components to a new frameset in 2024. A frameset with a nearly identical wheelbase, less BB drop, more reach, and a slightly steeper head tube angle caught my attention. If I do, you’ll read it here.</p>
