                    <p>For some time I've been using <a href="https://flink.run/">flink.run</a> to log my cycling activities in a <a href="#non-existing-post-with-id-21">Google sheet</a>. I kept a bunch of stats in that Google document and then every so often manually updated the stats here. Nicolas Zimmer, the creator of <a href="https://flink.run/">flink.run</a>, decided with heavy heart to shut down his service. As his small side project became more popular it started to take away lots of his personal time and cost him money; hundres of dollars per month. Time being a scarce resource, he decided it was time to pull the plug.</p>
<p>In order to continue populating my Google sheet with new activities I turned to <a href="https://zapier.com/">Zapier</a>, which can do the same thing, though it won't add any past activities, which <a href="https://flink.run/">flink.run</a> could do for you. With my stats in that Google sheet staying up to date, I dove into Google's <a href="https://datastudio.google.com/">Data Studio</a> to create a visual report of all my Strava cycling activities. After a few days playing with it, this is the current result.</p>

<p>After a couple of rides with the new handlebar setup, I have a better idea where I'll use a Ritchey Comp Kyote and where I'll mount a Jones H-Bar. The Kyote wins hands down on my 44 Marauder. There's a short, steep climb on my loop where a powerful acceleration at the bottom of the climb doesn't help to get to the top because the steep incline is full of roots. The only way to make it is to put all the power one has into the pedals and pick a good line to avoid the tallest roots. With the Jones H-Bar I never made it. I got close, but never quite made it all the way. Now, with the Ritchey Kyote I rode up the climb each time I hit it. What a difference a few centimeters in width can make.<br><br>But those extra centimeters can slow you down elsewhere. During the period when cattle is grazing on Jura pastures, fences are up everywhere and gates are closed. When you're lucky, you ride up to an above-ground cattle-guard and just ride across it. Unfortunately, most of them around here were designed with hikers in mind. With a narrow handlebar, some can be ridden, but with a handlebar as wide as the Kyote, the majority of above-ground cattle-guards are too narrow to get through. I also have a few trails where trees stand so tight, that it's almost unavoidable to hit my hands. The more I get used to the bar, the less often this should be happening, though.<br><br>The Ritchey Comp Kyote requires a much shorter stem. On my Marauder, which has a fairly conservative geometry with a traditional head tube angle and a reach designed around a set-back seat post, I went from a 100mm stem to 40mm. On a more modern bike geometry with a long reach and an already short stem, the bar would move one's hands too much forward. Here, a Jones H-Bar would be the better choice since you'll have more options to play with the length of a stem to get your hand position just right. Lastly, I would also say that one's wrists are far more relaxed with the 45° of a Jones bar. For long days in the saddle, the Jones provides more comfort and remains my top pick. So, you'll see me use both bars. Where power is needed such as a single-speed, I'll use the Ritchey bar. When I want to spare my wrists, I'll go for the Jones.</p>

                    <p>I've been using the <a href="http://flink.run/">flink.run</a> app to add my <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/133569">Strava</a> data to a Google sheet with a bunch of additional tables that crunch the numbers. Each time I add an activity to Strava, <a href="http://flink.run/">flink.run</a> adds a new row to the data table in my Google sheet. The stats in all the other calculated tables are therefore always up to date.</p>
<p>I sent my FortyFour Big Boy fat-bike into retirement and wanted to look up my first ride on it. On Strava there's no easy way to find the first activity with a specific gear. In my Google sheet it's a simple formula to look for the first occurrence of a specific gear within the activity table. Since I was at it, I added a first ride and last ride column to my gear table.</p>

<p>Of all the bikes I've used since joining <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/133569">Strava</a>, I've done the most rides and spent the most hours on my good old 44 Big Boy. 258 rides and 907 hours. No other bike comes even close to that. When it comes to total distance and total elevation, it's obviously a road bike that takes the top spot. It's my red Volagi Viaje RD, which I sold last year.</p>
<p>Having the total distance and total time for each bike, one can also calculate the average speed for each bike, which reveals some interesting results. My stainless steel Ritte road bike with a weight of about 8.4 kg is my fastest bike. It even managed to beat a much more aero carbon Neilpryde Alize, which at 6.8 kg was considerably lighter too. That's kind of nice actually since I've gotten older as well. Older dude on heavier and less aero bike has managed to keep his average speed. Nice!</p>
<p>The same is actually the case for my 29er mountain bikes. I was faster on both my steel Kid Dangerous and Marauder than on the 2 kg lighter Niner Air 9 Carbon. I did however climb more per mile on the Niner than the Marauder for instance, which means that on average rides on that bike were steeper. On the other hand, the average ride distance on the Niner was less than on the Marauder.</p>
<p>Lastly, looking at the Volagi Viaje SL and RD one could say that I'm about 1 km/h slower than on a road bike with skinny tires. But since I ride alone and don't have to keep up with anyone, who cares? The 27 rides on the Albarda, many of them on icy or snow covered roads, aren't yet a representative sample of rides. Average speed of that bike currently is closer to the three bikes I primarily rode on gravel; the two Focus and the Viaje CX.</p>

                    <p>A broken down car right ahead of Christmas and New Year, meant driving a loaner until we purchased a new car. No roomy vehicle meant no fat-biking. That was followed by one of the poorest winters in years for snow cover. No snow, oh well, no fat-biking. A new vehicle on our parking spot created another necessity - to safely transport my studded fatty inside the new car without damaging the interior. Tire studs are short, but they're awfully sharp and will scratch interior plastic panels and tear fabrics or leather. In our old car, I did my best to be careful. But a scratch now and then wasn't a big deal. With a brand new car however, being careful isn't quite enough. I wanted something that would protect our car from those sharp metal studs. Thanks to Google I came across a post in the fat-bike forum on MTBR which pointed me to Amy Middleton's <a href="https://bikejacket.net/">Bike Jackets</a>. I ordered one and then waited ages because it got hung up at Swiss customs. It didn't get much use during the no-show winter 19/20, but will hopefully come in handy for winter 20/21.</p>

<p>These bike jackets were not primarily designed for use inside the car, though they're great for that too. They were developed to protect your bike from snow, salt, dust and water when transporting it on a bike rack. Salt especially will corrode everything from chain to bearings. Handcrafted in the USA with durable, cold-hardy materials, a bike jacket zips securely onto your bike to prevent weather-related corrosion damage to your beloved bike. Or use it as I will to protect your car's interior from damage or dirt.</p>

                    <p>I joined <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/133569">Strava</a> in August of 2011 and have been using it ever since. I don't dig into the numbers much, nor do I ride with any particular goals. Cycling is mainly a way to stay in shape, enjoy the outdoors and have fun. Strava just offers a social connection with like-minded athletes all over the world. It's a great way to stay in touch with people I've ridden and a great place to make new connections. Besides the social aspect of the site, it's also a great activity journal. Based on the data Strava collects, I've maintained the following separate cycling statistics:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://collideous.github.io/annual-stats-by-bike/">Bike Statistics</a>: Yearly distance ridden, elevation climbed, hours ridden and number of rides grouped by bike used.</li>
<li>Yearly Statistics: Monthly distance ridden, elevation climbed, hours ridden and number of rides since 2012.</li>
<li>Two Year Comparison Statistics: Distance and time comparison between two years starting from 2012.</li>
<li>Ride Type Statistics: Number of rides between 2012 and the present based on type of ride (road, cross, mountain, fat).</li>
</ul>

<p>Strava gives you a bunch of data, but not everything. Personally, I like to have an idea how often I use a specific bike and how many miles I ride with it during the course of the year. Strava has that data, but unfortunately doesn't present it to you. I spent a couple of hours with <a href="https://www.klipfolio.com/">Klipfolio</a> and whipped up a dashboard for myself.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/tags/klipfolio">Screenshot</a>, since the dashboard was accessible to nobody but me. Sadly, Klipfolio sunsetted the freemium accounts at the end of April 2019 and their basic account package is $49 a month. It was a great tool to have, but their pricing is definitely geared towards business users.</p>
