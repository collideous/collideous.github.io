No unnecessarily burned gas, no penny spent and no time travelling wasted. So, I've always been biking in the winter. Before moving to California I did many winter rides on my 26er mountain bikes at the time. Upon our return 10 years later, I snow-biked on my 29er single-speed.<br><br>When fat-bikes started becoming popular in the US and parts become more readily available in 2012, I decided to get one. I often carried my 29er through deep snow, sometimes for hours in the hope of finding rideable conditions. A fat-bike, so my thinking, would allow me to ride more and walk less. So I had my first fat-bike built - a 44 Big Boy. I've been fat-biking ever since.<br><br>Fat-biking strangely never really caught on in Switzerland. I for my part couldn't think not having one. In fact, if I could only own one bike, it'd be a fat-bike. It's by far the most versatile and most capable bike. It's obviously the best tool for soft surfaces such as snow and sand, but it's just as fun as a trail bike. In fact, in many circumstances it's superior to bikes with normal tires thanks to the huge tire volume and the unmatched grip of those nearly pressureless tires. The bike climbs and rolls over stuff like nothing else. And that go-anywhere attitude stamped into the genes of a fat-bike has ultimately taken me off-trail - a new way of mountain biking.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 27, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://collideous.github.io/collideous.github.io/tags/cycling/">cycling</a></li><li><a href="https://collideous.github.io/collideous.github.io/tags/fat-biking/">fat biking</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://collideous.github.io/collideous.github.io/media/website/profile.picture.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Patrick Strahm"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://collideous.github.io/collideous.github.io/authors/patrick-strahm/" class="invert" rel="author">Patrick Strahm</a></h3><p>Mountains are not stadiums where I satisfy my ambition to achieve, they are the cathedrals where I practice my religion.</p></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://collideous.github.io/collideous.github.io/single-speeding/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Single Speeding </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://collideous.github.io/collideous.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__comments"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5">Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
