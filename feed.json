I started exploring things outside what is considered a “road bike.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"dropcap\">Without fixation on grams and watts and without having to worry about keeping up in a group ride, my view on the “ideal” road bike has evolved. Today, I take a different approach to cycling and say “If it ain’t broke, break it.” The Volagi Viajes and the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/\">Nordest Albarda</a> were mostly about discovering wider tires and smaller wheels. I went from <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/40-is-the-new-28/\">28mm to 38mm</a> and landed at 48mm wide tires. To fit this tire width and to keep the bikes lively and agile, I swapped 700C wheels <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda-on-650b/\">for 650B</a>. The Nordest was a first sniff at a slacker frame geometry in combination with a lower bottom bracket. The Marin Gestalt X12 however, allowed me to throw everything I know overboard. It’s a gravel bike, unlike any other gravel bike I’ve ridden. It has a <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/the-geometry-of-a-gravel-bike/\">geometry</a> that heavily borrows from a modern mountain bike. Its head tube angle is slacker than any of my mountain bikes. It has a long reach, a short stem, and a long wheelbase. I also set it up with a wider handlebar than what I’ve ridden up to now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-01.jpg\" data-size=\"3757x2113\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-01-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Marin Gestalt X12.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Marin Gestalt X12.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-04.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-04-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Rotor Aldhu crankset and Wolf Tooth chainring.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Oval chainring.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-02.jpg\" data-size=\"3512x1976\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-02-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Marin Gestalt X12 from the side.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Side shot.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-03.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-03-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Bottom bracket area.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Bottom bracket.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Road.cc recently ran a feature on the rising cost of cycling.

On the gravel side of things, you have the <a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/ch/en/diverge-str-pro/p/200577\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S-Works Diverge STR</a> with an SRAM Red/XX1 mullet setup setting you back CHF 10’000.00. As a young whippersnapper, I would have lusted over these financially out-of-reach bikes. Now in my mid-fifties, such outrageously expensive bikes no longer spark my interest. Could I afford one? Yeah, I could! Would I? No, that money is better invested in my retirement account. Cycling is more fun on equipment far cheaper than that. I would even argue that if you sell one of your kidneys for a high-end bike, you will never be honest with yourself about the quality of the bike. It will be the best bike you have owned, even if it causes you back pain and rides terribly. If an inexpensive bike turns out to be a poor fit, you will have no problem admitting it to yourself or your riding buddies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-05.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-05-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Bottom bracket area from below.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>BB area.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-06.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-06-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"SRAM XPLR all-steel cassette.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>All-steel cassette.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-07.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-07-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"SRAM Rival XPLR AXS derailleur.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Rival derailleur.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-08.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-08-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Front hub and brake rotor.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Jagwire rotor.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The good news is that there are still companies out there that try to package fun into affordability. They do so without silly technical gimmicks or claimed aerodynamic improvements but with simple bikes that try nothing more than put a smile on a rider’s face. And when I’m on a bike that’s what truly counts, not grams and watts. One such company is <a href=\"https://www.marinbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marin</a>. As someone who got into mountain biking in the mid-eighties, Marin is a familiar name. The company has its roots in that era, and its bikes were quite popular at the time. To be honest, Marin sort of disappeared off my radar screen. One recent day, while googling for gravel bikes with slacker head tube angles, I came across Marin’s <a href=\"https://www.marinbikes.com/bikes/2023-gestalt-x10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2023 Gestalt X10</a>. I loved it at first sight. The frame geometry, the tube shapes, the tire clearance, the colors, and particularly the price. Browsing their whole catalog of bike offerings, I discovered that that’s what they do nowadays - affordable and attractive no-nonsense bikes for cyclists who cannot throw the entirety of their disposable incomes at their hobby.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-09.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-09-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Syntace FlatForce 44 stem.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Syntace stem.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-10.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-10-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Low and short.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Low and short.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-11.jpg\" data-size=\"3654x2055\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-11-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Syntace TwinFix mount.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>TwinFix.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-12.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-12-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Vincero Design edgePRO bottle mount.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Vincero edgePRO.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The Gestalt X10 can be purchased for CHF 1'629.00. At that price, it comes with mechanical disc brakes by Tektro, a MicroSHIFT Advent X 10-speed derailleur, and an aluminum handlebar, seat post, and rims. It’s not a bike that would catch anyone’s interest in Switzerland because none of the components say Shimano or SRAM. And without an additional zero to its price tag, it’s a cheap man’s bike in this nation anyway. In fact, when I contacted the bike shop about it, they said they wouldn’t stock it because of the mechanical disc brakes. Swiss cyclists apparently only want hydraulic brakes. While I prefer hydraulic disc brakes for the hilly Jura, I had two bikes with <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=77168304%40N00&amp;view_all=1&amp;text=spyre\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TRP Spyre</a> brakes. On flat terrain, they performed just fine. The independent pad adjustment and the simple fact that you can maintain everything with a few Allen keys instead of a bleed kit still make such brakes a valid option. It’s a bit under-geared for me with a 42T chainring and an 11-51T SunRace cassette. I pulled off all the original components, which I’m keeping for the day I want to sell the bike. Instead of the OEM parts, I tuned it up with the components listed below. All in all, I spent CHF 3’200.00 to build the X10 into an X12. At the moment the X12 is set up with a <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/tags/nox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">7-year-old</a> Nox Composites Citico wheelset. I will be ordering a pair of Light Bicycle <a href=\"https://www.lightbicycle.com/700C-gravel-bicycle-rims-40mm-wide-44mm-deep-aero-clincher.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WG44 rims</a> in August to have them laced up to <a href=\"https://www.hopetech.com/news/the-all-new-pro-5-hub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hope Pro 5</a> hubs in early October. A new bike deserves a new pair of wheels.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-color: #7e8c8d; border-style: solid; width: 100%;\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #ced4d9;\">\n<th colspan=\"3\">Info</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>First Ride</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">July 27th, 2023</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bike Weight</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">8.9 kg</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame Size</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Large</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame Color</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Blue / grey</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mileage</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">24.3 km</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #ced4d9;\">\n<th colspan=\"3\">Components</th>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #ecf0f1;\">\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Brand</th>\n<th>Model</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame</td>\n<td>Marin</td>\n<td>Series 3 Beyond Road</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fork</td>\n<td>Marin</td>\n<td>Full Carbon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stem</td>\n<td>Syntace</td>\n<td>Flatforce TwinFix Torx 44mm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Headset</td>\n<td>FSA</td>\n<td>Orbit IS, tapered</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Handlebar</td>\n<td>Easton</td>\n<td>EC70 AX Carbon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Seatpost</td>\n<td>Easton</td>\n<td>EC90 ISA Carbon</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saddle</td>\n<td>Prologo</td>\n<td>Dimension AGX Nack</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brake Rotors</td>\n<td>Jagwire</td>\n<td>Pro LR2, 160mm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brakes</td>\n<td>SRAM</td>\n<td>Rival eTap AXS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brake Levers</td>\n<td>SRAM</td>\n<td>Rival eTap AXS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Derailleur</td>\n<td>SRAM</td>\n<td>Rival XPLR eTap AXS</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cassette</td>\n<td>SRAM</td>\n<td>Rival XPLR, XG-1251, 10-44T</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chain</td>\n<td>SRAM</td>\n<td>Force, CN-FRC-D1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Crankset</td>\n<td>Rotor</td>\n<td>Aldhu, 175mm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chainring</td>\n<td>Wolf Tooth</td>\n<td>Drop Stop, 42T</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bottom Bracket</td>\n<td>RWC</td>\n<td>External BB30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pedals</td>\n<td>Crank Brothers</td>\n<td>Eggbeater 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wheels</td>\n<td>Nox Composites</td>\n<td>Citico</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tires</td>\n<td>René Herse</td>\n<td>Snoqualmie Pass TC</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

They are efficient, practical, surface-agnostic bikes that bridge the functionality gap between road and off-road. In this post, I want to look at the geometry of the bikes I have ridden in the last nine years.</p>\n\n<p>I started on a red <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-sl/\">Volagi Viaje</a> with 700C wheels in March 2014. The Viaje, introduced on <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/874048428/the-viaje-bicycle-engineered-for-adventure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kickstarter</a> in August of 2012, was a bike ahead of its time. Its frame and fork had enough clearance for 40mm wide 700C tires and offered plenty of room for 650B <a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/collections/road-plus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RoadPlus</a> tires. It was engineered for adventure. Many today equate adventure with bike-packing, so in this day and age, I would not view the Viaje as an ideal adventure bike. It lacks the many mounting points to carry bags, and the magnificent Long Bow Flex Stays cannot handle much more than the weight of the rider. I loved it, though, and I still do. Born in 2012, the Volagi Viaje had a fairly traditional road bike geometry. It rode like a road bike with a head angle of 72º, a BB drop of 70 mm, short chain stays, and a short wheelbase. It was agile and quick steering. It was fun on <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/gravel-grinding/\">gravel</a>, but I always had to pay attention to where it was going. This got even more pronounced when I built my third Viaje with 650B wheels. Equipped with smaller wheels, the Volagi Viaje tends to oversteer when leaning into a turn.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/\">Nordest Albarda</a> I built in the fall of 2019 is a different machine. Nordest designed it more along the lines of a comfort bike. A semi-slack head tube angle of 70º and a high 74mm trail result in a bike with a lot of steering stability. One can more easily take the eyes off the road without immediately veering into the ditch. The 28mm longer front center is another good indicator of a well-mannered ride feel. Thanks to the short chainstays and extremely low bottom bracket the Albarda is by no means lethargic. It comes to life at speed. One thing to point out is that I went with a custom geometry because the stock geometry was a bit too upright for my taste. I ordered a medium frame with a 15mm shorter head tube - the head tube of a small. From October 2019 to March 2021, I rode the bike on 700C wheels. In the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda-2021-update/\">spring of 2021</a>, I swapped the groupset from a 2x11-speed SRAM Red eTap HRD to a 2x12 Red AXS groupset and went 650B. This reduces the trail from 74mm to about 68mm and slightly lowers the wheel flop. And it is noticeable! Like the Volagi Viaje, I prefer the Nordest Albarda with 650B wheels.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"5\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/Geometry-Comparison.webp\" data-size=\"2390x1280\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/Geometry-Comparison-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Geometry comparison.\" width=\"720\" height=\"386\"></a>\n<figcaption>Geometry comparison.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/Nordest-Albarda-Marin-Gestalt-X10.webp\" data-size=\"2250x1100\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/Nordest-Albarda-Marin-Gestalt-X10-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Nordest Albarda vs. Marin Gestalt X10\" width=\"720\" height=\"352\"></a>\n<figcaption>Nordest Albarda vs. Marin Gestalt X10</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/Volagi-Viaje-Marin-Gestalt-X10.webp\" data-size=\"2250x1100\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/Volagi-Viaje-Marin-Gestalt-X10-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Volagi Viaje vs. Marin Gestalt X10\" width=\"720\" height=\"352\"></a>\n<figcaption>Volagi Viaje vs. Marin Gestalt X10</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/Evil-Chamois-Hagar-Marin-Gestalt-X10.webp\" data-size=\"2250x1100\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/Evil-Chamois-Hagar-Marin-Gestalt-X10-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Evil Chamois Hagar vs. Marin Gestalt X10\" width=\"720\" height=\"352\"></a>\n<figcaption>Evil Chamois Hagar vs. Marin Gestalt X10</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/easton-ax-handlebar-measurements.webp\" data-size=\"1000x735\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/easton-ax-handlebar-measurements-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Easton AX handlebar measurements.\" width=\"720\" height=\"529\"></a>\n<figcaption>Handlebar measurements.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.marinbikes.com/bikes/2023-gestalt-x10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2023 Marin Gestalt X10</a> is a whole different beast. The vast majority of gravel bikes are essentially nothing more than road bikes with room for large tires. The Marin X10 and XR, on the other hand, borrow a lot from modern mountain bikes. And that's why I pulled the trigger and got one. So, what about that geometry? The most eye-popping differences are head tube angle, reach, and a dramatically elongated front-center as a combination of the two. To keep my position, I shortened the stem from 110/100 mm (Viaje/Albarda) to 44 mm. I mounted a wider handlebar to better deal with the very high trail figure and the increased wheel flop. It’s an <a href=\"https://eastoncycling.com/products/ec70-ax-bar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Easton EC70 AX</a> in 46 cm. With a 16º flare, the bar has 53 cm in the drops. Maybe also to note, based on Marin’s sizing chart, I’m smack in between an M and an L. I went with a large. The next couple of weeks will show if Marin is onto something with such an MTB-inspired, hard-charging, rough-and-rowdy gravel/adventure bike.</p>",

The project was fully funded within 12 hours. Cycplus was established in Chengdu, China, in 2014. They make other pumps and also offer various cycling computers. Like many other such companies, they didn’t go to Indiegogo for the funding but to gauge the interest for such a tiny pump. Had I not seen videos of how well this small pump inflates a bicycle tire, I wouldn’t have ordered one from the company’s <a href=\"https://cycplus.aliexpress.com/store/5796744\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">storefront</a> on Ali Express. But that tiny thing actually works. Like everything else I’ve purchased on Ali Express, the Cycplus Cube arrived at my doorstep in Grenchen, Switzerland in no time. A small package takes an 8'000 kilometer journey and arrives a little over a week later. What a small world! The air intake was the first thing I was confused about when I held it in my hands. The air from the pump’s nozzle must come from somewhere, and I didn’t know from where. I grabbed the small manual to find out that the USB-C charging port is also the pump’s air intake. How cool is that? I charged and then tested the pump by inflating a 29er bike tire. The pump did that in about a minute and a half. I didn’t test how many tires I could inflate on a single battery charge, but based on how quickly it was fully recharged, I think I could have easily inflated another two tires.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/74/gallery/cycplus-cube-01.jpg\" data-size=\"3026x2161\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/74/gallery/cycplus-cube-01-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"My toolkit.\" width=\"720\" height=\"514\"></a>\n<figcaption>My toolkit.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/74/gallery/cycplus-cube-02.jpg\" data-size=\"3207x1924\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/74/gallery/cycplus-cube-02-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The old and the new pump.\" width=\"720\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption>Old and new.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/74/gallery/cycplus-cube-03.jpg\" data-size=\"3319x1867\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/74/gallery/cycplus-cube-03-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The old and the new pump.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Old and new.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>I know cyclists who don’t carry any tools with them. They have a cell phone and a wife at home who will drop everything to pick them up whenever their bike breaks down. My wife would be mildly annoyed if I would call her each time I needed help. I rather carry a small toolkit with me to help myself. This toolkit used to be heavier. It has gotten smaller as I reduced it to the bare minimum. The Cube has now freed one jersey pocket in which I used to carry a small dual-stage hand pump. I can bring along my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/dji-action-2/\">DJI Action 2</a> camera with a small tripod in that free pocket instead.</p>",

I rode <a href=\"https://www.fizik.com/eu_en/antares-r1.html\">Fizik Antares</a> saddles in various models for the next eight years. There were R1, R3 with carbon braided rails or less expensive K:ium metal rails. My 44 Kid Dangerous 29er and my 44 Big Boy fat bike were given the top-of-the-line <a href=\"https://www.fizik.com/eu_en/antares-00.html\">Antares 00</a>. An Antares VS was on my red Volagi, and an <a href=\"https://www.fizik.com/eu_en/antares-r1-versus-evo.html\">R1 Versus EVO</a> still sits on top of my beige <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-sl/\">Volagi</a>. When I rebuilt my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/ritte-snob-disc/\">Ritte Snob Disc</a> road bike, I gave it the latest generation Antares 00. The Antares uses a generously proportioned rear and a relatively firm carbon-reinforced shell. Its flat shape meshes well with my anatomy and offers excellent long-distance comfort.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/73//gallery/saddles-05.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x2248\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/73//gallery/saddles-05-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"White and black Fizik Antares R3 with K:ium rails.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>White Fizik Antares R3.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/73//gallery/saddles-08.jpg\" data-size=\"3264x2448\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/73//gallery/saddles-08-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Black and white Fizik Antares R1 with carbon rails.\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Black Fizik Antares R1.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/73//gallery/saddles-07.jpg\" data-size=\"5184x3888\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/73//gallery/saddles-07-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Black Fizik Antares R3 with carbon rails.\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>All black Fizik Antares R3.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/73//gallery/saddles-06.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x2248\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/73//gallery/saddles-06-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Black and pink Fizik Antares R3 saddle.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Pink Fizik Antares R3.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>In 2019 the third saddle transition unfolded with the construction of my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/\">Nordest Albarda</a>. After years of extra-long saddle designs, several manufacturers introduced saddles with a sawed-off nose. Prologo was one of them with the 245mm short Dimension. That’s 30mm shorter than the Fizik Antares saddles I was used to. The Prologo <a href=\"https://prologo.it/en/products/dimension-143\">Dimension Nack</a> has a big pressure-relief channel, plenty of high-density padding, and a superbly comfortable, stepped nose. It was an immediate love affair. When it came to picking a saddle for my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/stooge-mk5/\">Stooge MK5</a> rigid 27.5+ mountain bike, it was a no-brainer that the choice fell onto another short Prologo saddle.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/73//gallery/saddles-09.jpg\" data-size=\"5184x3888\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/73//gallery/saddles-09-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Special edition Fizik Antares VS saddle.\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Fizik Antares VS.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/73//gallery/saddles-10.jpg\" data-size=\"3264x2448\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/73//gallery/saddles-10-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Black Fizik Antares 00 saddle.\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Fizik Antares 00.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/73//gallery/saddles-11.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x3000\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/73//gallery/saddles-11-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Black Prologo Dimension Nack saddle.\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Prologo Dimension Nack.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/73//gallery/saddles-12.jpg\" data-size=\"3623x2233\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/73//gallery/saddles-12-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Black Prologo Scratch M5 Nack saddle.\" width=\"720\" height=\"444\"></a>\n<figcaption>Prologo Scratch M5 Nack.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Because I don’t find open-channel saddles practical for dirt or gravel riding, I selected the <a href=\"https://prologo.it/en/collections/marathon-xc/products/scratch-m5\">Scratch M5</a> for the MK5. Prologo says that the rounded shape of the Scratch M5 allows the pelvis to rotate naturally. It favors the distribution of pressure over a larger surface area, creates stability, and supports the lumbar region. I’m not expert enough to confirm that, but my butt definitely likes sitting on it. My Marin Gestalt X12 will be equipped with the same Scratch M5, while both Fortyfours will say goodbye to the Antares 00 to welcome the latest of the Prologo saddle family, the <a href=\"https://prologo.it/en/collections/marathon-xc/products/scratch-ndr\">Scratch NDR</a> with Nack rails. The ergonomic Scratch NDR is the off-road evolution of the Scratch M5 and is specifically designed for XC and marathon riding.</p>",

German speakers would say “<em>Bewährtes soll man nicht verändern</em>.” When it comes to cycling, most of us stick to that. We ride something, we like it, and we are therefore rarely willing to change it. Project X12 is an inexpensive platform to question everything I know. It may not be “the” answer, but it will certainly provide a ton of answers. And that, for now, is as much as I am saying about this endeavor.</p>",

Anyway, I had a chance to wear the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/shopping-on-aliexpress/\">vests I bought</a> on <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AliExpress</a> in early November, and they are nice to wear. Everything stays in place when I fill the three back pockets with the items I always carry on a ride. They are not made with a wind-breaking material but from a typical polyester with some stretch. All have already been machine-washed and kept their shape and color.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/71/gallery/raudax-clothing-1.jpg\" data-size=\"2127x2127\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/71/gallery/raudax-clothing-1-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Camouflage thermal cycling jersey by Raudax.\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Jersey by Raudax.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/71/gallery/raudax-clothing-2.jpg\" data-size=\"2052x2801\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/71/gallery/raudax-clothing-2-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Camouflage thermal cycling vest by Raudax.\" width=\"720\" height=\"983\"></a>\n<figcaption>Vest by Raudax.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/71/gallery/raudax-clothing-3.jpg\" data-size=\"2374x2374\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/71/gallery/raudax-clothing-3-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Thermal winter jacket by Raudax.\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Jacket by Raudax.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/71/gallery/raudax-clothing-4.jpg\" data-size=\"2155x2155\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/71/gallery/raudax-clothing-4-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Camo vest over winter jacket.\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Jacket and vest.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>With that positive experience, I bought three more items from a different vendor at the end of December. This time I filled my shopping cart with a long sleeve jersey, a jacket, and a vest with a thermal fleece for winter temperatures. All three are made by <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/store/5885239\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Raudax</a>, a Chinese brand that sells its products primarily on AliExpress. Just like the three vests purchased in November, there is nothing to complain about. The zippers appear to be good quality, and the garments are neatly sewn. The fabrics feel great, and the fit is right. They are sized a bit large, but I generally wear two or even three layers underneath a jacket in the winter. So a relaxed fit is just what I need for the outermost layer of clothing. If the remainder of winter stays as warm as it has been, I will sadly not get a chance to wear them. And since I cannot travel, I cannot go where the snow is.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>2023 Raudax Winter Cycling Thermal Fleece <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004948247790.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jacket</a> - CHF 16.94</li>\n<li>2023 Raudax Winter Cycling Thermal Fleece <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004953041850.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vest</a> - CHF 14.38</li>\n<li>2021 Raudax Winter Cycling Thermal Fleece <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003198368423.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Jersey</a> - CHF 17.31</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a total of <strong>CHF 57.60</strong> including shipping.</p>",

I popped on a 3.0” wide WTB Bridger in the back. In 2021, I bought four of these from <a href=\"https://www.chainreactioncycles.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chain Reaction Cycles</a> for $14.00 a piece. Both these tires weigh considerably more than the Nobby Nic. The WTB Bridger is a few millimeters narrower, but interestingly, it is a good centimeter taller than the German Schwalbe.

Except for the summer months, I generally wear a vest over a short or long-sleeve jersey. During the winter, I also slip a vest over a winter jacket. It’s a piece of clothing I wear on most rides. A while back, I bought two camouflage-colored vests from <a href=\"https://www.primaleurope.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Primal</a>. I liked the combination of these camo prints with solid-colored jerseys and decided to look for others. I found three cool prints at the <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/store/5617285\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">JoseMX</a> store on AliExpress. I wasn’t expecting quality for CHF 16.59 a piece, but I was pleasantly surprised when they arrived. The fabric is nice, the stitching is well done, and the fit is perfect. One thing that would make these three vests even more useful, would be the use of a wind-breaking fabric for the front. Whenever windchill could be an issue, I certainly won’t be using them.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/69/gallery/ali-express-vests-04.jpg\" data-size=\"2368x2368\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/69/gallery/ali-express-vests-04-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Camouflage printed vest and ink blue jersey.\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Blue and white.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/69/gallery/ali-express-vests-05.jpg\" data-size=\"2633x2220\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/69/gallery/ali-express-vests-05-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Camouflage printed windbreaker vests.\" width=\"720\" height=\"607\"></a>\n<figcaption>Windbreaker vests.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Because of that, I bought two other vests from another AliExpress shop. These are wind-breakers. As far as material and workmanship there is nothing to complain. They’re well made. The manufacturer could improve them, though, by making the back pockets longer. I carry my phone, an iPhone 12 mini, and a tool pouch in these pockets, and my small iPhone sticks out of the side pockets. In comparison to other vests, the pockets could be 6-7 centimeters longer. Lastly, the shop sent one of the vests in a different color that didn’t match what I ordered. But at CHF 12.16 a piece, I’m not going to make a fuss about it.</p>",

I would have loved to purchase a bling set of cranks with gold anodization. Leonardi offers their <a href=\"https://www.leonardiracing.com/en/crankset/11-5-capo-gold.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Capo cranks</a> like that. Ignite Components has the <a href=\"https://www.ignitecomponents.com/product-page/catalyst-fatbike-cranks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Catalyst fat-bike cranks</a> that can be made in any color. Leonardi doesn’t currently offer fat-bike axles for their Capo cranks and Ignite only offers one Q-factor that is too narrow for my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">Snakedriver</a>. So, I had to keep doing more homework. Homework is necessary for any crankset purchase no matter the type of bike. There are axle diameters, axle lengths, chain lines, Q-factor, and chain stay clearances to consider.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-1.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-1-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Fortyfour Snakedriver.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Fortyfour Snakedriver.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-2.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-2-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Non-drive-side Race Face Turbine crank.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Non-drive-side crank.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-3.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-3-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"An all-new drivetrain.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>New drivetrain.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-4.jpg\" data-size=\"3473x1954\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-4-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Garbaruk 30T Melon with Boost offset but flipped.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Flipped chainring.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>I immediately started looking at Race Face. Their Cinch-type cranksets come in a lot of flavors, and there’s a wide range of axles available. First, I looked if all the numbers would match up for the <a href=\"https://www.raceface.com/collections/cranks/products/next-sl-crankset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Next SL</a> carbon cranks. But they didn’t. The numbers would have lined up for Race Face’s other carbon crank, the <a href=\"https://www.raceface.com/collections/cranks/products/next-r-crankset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Next R</a>. But this crank was a little busy on the logos. I never cared for the huge “XX” on my old SRAM cranks. I wanted something with no or at least small logos. It just happened that Race Face released a new <a href=\"https://www.raceface.com/collections/cranks/products/turbine-crankset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Turbine</a> aluminum crankset in a modern remake of the legendary Turbine LP cranks (photos below). I studied the <a href=\"https://r2-bike.com/docs/race_face/turbine_2022_spezifikationen.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">drawing</a>, punched the numbers, and came to the conclusion that this was the perfect one. The Q-factor of 208mm with an RF169 spindle is 5mm wider than SRAM’s XX1 Eagle DUB SL crankset. The SRAM cranks were a little tight on my frame and only left 2-3mm clearance to the chain stays. 2.8mm more clearance felt right. The RF169 spindle is for fat bikes with 4” tires and a 170/177 rear axle. My <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">Snakedriver</a>, however, runs 4.5” tires and is equipped with a 197mm wide rear hub. To get the chain line right, a Boost chainring with a 3-4mm offset needs to be flipped. The Cinch system, thankfully, lets you do that.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-5.jpg\" data-size=\"3668x2063\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-5-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Drive-side crank setup.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Drive-side crank.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-6.jpg\" data-size=\"3516x1978\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-6-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Wide spacer to the left, narrow to the right.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>The spacers.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-7.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-7-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Drive-side with a flipped Boost chainring.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Flipped chainring.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-8.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-8-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"A new drivetrain ready for action.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Ready for action.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Speaking of flipping a Boost chainring, when it is oval, it’s also necessary to rotate it once flipped. I took a piece of paper, installed the chainring the way it is intended, drew the outline of the ring onto the paper, marked the direction of the crank, then flipped the ring and rotated it until it matched the outline on the paper. Lastly, it came to figuring out the right axle spacers and mounting them. Fortunately, I had plenty of 30mm axle spacers at various widths. I also had two different <a href=\"https://chrisking.com/products/threadfit-30-bottom-bracket-fit-kits\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chris King BB fits kits</a> on hand. First, I popped in the plastic BB sleeves with the thicker shoulder and used a 6mm spacer on the drive side. This would have worked, although the drive-side crank was a little closer to the chain stay than the crank on the non-drive side. So, I exchanged the BB sleeves for the ones with the thin shoulder and corrected with a wider spacer. This equalized the clearance between the cranks and the chain stays. Lastly, I needed to find the right spacer to fill the gap on the non-drive side. A 2.5mm wide spacer did just that.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-lp-1.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x2248\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-lp-1-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The legendary Race Face Turbine LP cranks.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>One of two pairs.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-lp-2.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x2248\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-lp-2-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The legendary Race Face Turbine LP cranks.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Drive-side.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-lp-3.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x2248\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-lp-3-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The legendary Race Face Turbine LP cranks.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>New old stock.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-lp-4.jpg\" data-size=\"4000x2248\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/68/gallery/raceface-turbine-lp-4-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The legendary Race Face Turbine LP cranks.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>LPs with ISIS spline.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>With an all-new drivetrain, the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">Snakedriver</a> is ready for winter if winter will show up.

The Bern Brentwood fit right in there, although it wasn’t perfect. At the top, it had six openings that were entry points for snow on days with heavy snowfall. While I still wanted a helmet with vents, the ideal helmet would have none on top. I found just that with <a href=\"https://www.kask.com/en-us/cycling/moebius_24_97.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Kask’s Moebius</a> urban helmet. Another interesting helmet in the same category is the <a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/us/en/tone/p/220797\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Specialized Tone</a>. I went with the Moebius because of its detachable visor and because it covers the back of one’s head more than the Tone. As far as design, the Specialized Tone certainly looks sleeker. In the case of the two, I picked function over form. Let’s not forget that my use case isn’t what the designers of those helmets had in mind when they drafted them on the drawing boards. Well, winter can come as far as I’m concerned.</p>",
