Unfortunately, I only managed to head out for a ride on Monday, the last day of my extended weekend. On Sunday, I had my booster shot midday, which meant not enough time before the appointment, and then it was too late to head to Prés d'Orvin, which is a popular weekend destination for anyone wanting to go into the snow. On a side note, I was pretty impressed with how well organized the vaccination center was and how quickly I was in and out of there with a booster shot into my left shoulder and a new certificate in my right hand. Back to the topic; on weekends I prefer to be in Prés d'Orvin before 8AM and be done with my ride when the masses arrive. This year, I'm not able to leave this early, so I'm less inclined to drive up there. But, on a weekday like this Monday, the place isn't busy. Traffic is light, and parking is plentiful. The ski lifts were operating, but the slope wasn't busy. I decided to climb it for my first descent of the winter. The snow was great, but poor visibility due to heavy fog made descending challenging.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-4.jpg\" data-size=\"3838x1725\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-4-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Alone at the Chasseral antenna.\" width=\"720\" height=\"324\"></a>\n<figcaption>Chasseral antenna.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-5.jpg\" data-size=\"3831x1642\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-5-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The sunny view from the top of the Chasseral.\" width=\"720\" height=\"309\"></a>\n<figcaption>Top of the Chasseral.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-6.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-6-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The action starts right there.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Crest trail.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Once at the bottom, I turned west to climb towards the Place Centrale. The winter hiking trails were perfectly groomed all the way to the cross-country skiing center. From there, I had to hop on the ice-covered road for about a kilometer, until the winter hiking trail continued off to the left. The official winter hiking path, when groomed, makes a turn eastwards to bring people to the Place Centrale. To my surprise, that upper leg of the trail was missing. Fortunately for me, hordes of snowshoers had taken the straight way up the mountain on the weekend, leaving behind a perfectly rideable trail from bottom to top. I finally got out of the fog while getting up that climb. I dropped down on the northern side, rode the cross-country ski track for a few hundred meters, then took the straight way to the Métairie du Milieu de Bienne, where I hopped back on the cross-country ski track. It dropped me right off at the backside of the Chasseral. The climb to the antenna that followed wasn't rideable. It rarely is.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-7.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-7-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Leaving the Chasseral behind.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Trail fun.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-8.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-8-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"A gorgeous day to be up there.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Gorgeous day.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-9.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-9-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The trail couldn't have been better.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Ideal conditions.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The best followed at that point; the crest trail eastwards back to the Place Centrale. It was rideable all the way, even some of the challenging drops that are formed by snow accumulation. The dropper seat post comes in handy along this trail. Each time the trail drops, I lower the dropper. Each time the trail is flat or has an incline, I move the saddle back to the top. After 3 years of usage, the thing needs to be serviced, though. Most droppers aren't user-serviceable and need to be sent in for service. I hate that. This is the main reason I've never and will never own a full-suspension bike or even a hardtail. I simply don't want parts on a bike that I can't easily service myself. Because a dropper post offers some real benefits, particularly for a fat-bike ridden in snow, I have one on my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">Snakedriver</a>. I don't have one on any of my other bikes and decided not to equip my <a href=\"#non-existing-post-with-id-46\">Stooge MK5</a> with one. A telescoping seat post will wear out even quicker than 3 years on a bike ridden on dusty or muddy trails.</p>",

This Thursday, I had Patrik at <a href=\"https://www.47grad-nord.ch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">47° Nord</a> install the headset. He faced and reamed the headtube, faced the steerer, installed the race, and pressed in the headset cups. Lastly, he cut the fork steerer with a pipe cutter a few levels above the one I have in my toolbox. While I could do this work myself, buying the necessary tools to do this every couple of years just isn't worth the expense.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-4.jpg\" data-size=\"2863x2449\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-4-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Enve aluminum stem.\" width=\"720\" height=\"616\"></a>\n<figcaption>Enve stem.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-5.jpg\" data-size=\"3137x2738\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-5-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Formula Cura 4 rear brake caliper.\" width=\"720\" height=\"628\"></a>\n<figcaption>Rear brake.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-6.jpg\" data-size=\"3494x2534\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-6-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"180mm TRP Centerlock rotor.\" width=\"720\" height=\"522\"></a>\n<figcaption>Centerlock rotor.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>On Thursday afternoon, I assembled much of the bike. I cut the brake hoses and bled the brakes only to realize that I didn't like how I routed the rear brake hose. Typically, I run it from the right side of the handlebar around the head tube to the left. The rear brake hoses on both my <a href=\"https://www.44bikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fortyfour</a> bikes run that way and enter the side of the top tube. However, the rear brake hose on the Stooge MK5 runs along the underside of the down tube. This lengthens the hose and brings it much closer to the lower headset cup and the fork crown. When riding, it'll oscillate up and down, rattling each time it hits the fork crown. I have to shorten it and run it to the down tube on the right side. The point it'll make contact with the paint of the head tube will be protected with clear frame-protecting tape. The hose to the front brake caliper was also routed differently than usual. Typically, I run it up the backside of the fork leg and let it loop to the brake lever. With the design of the Stooge fork and the position of my left brake lever, the brake hose didn't want to stay on the backside of the fork leg. It slipped to the outside of the fork leg. I wrapped it around the inside of the fork leg, which gave it a natural curve to the brake lever. Transparent skin armor protects the paint wherever the hose contacts the fork.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-7.jpg\" data-size=\"3687x3024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-7-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Seat tube and seat stay junction.\" width=\"720\" height=\"591\"></a>\n<figcaption>Seat tube.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-8.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2627\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-8-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Fork crown and Cane Creek headset.\" width=\"720\" height=\"469\"></a>\n<figcaption>Cane Creek.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-9.jpg\" data-size=\"3593x2845\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-9-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Curved seat tube piece.\" width=\"720\" height=\"570\"></a>\n<figcaption>Curves.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Still on the to-do list is replacing the small steel bolts at the dropouts with golden titanium bolts and the bottom bracket, which will be my own design. The design is done. It needs to be machined and anodized so that the MK5 can be completed. I hope to get this all done before the end of the year, though it wouldn't be a big deal if it drags into next year.

But I found a good deal on a discontinued <a href=\"https://www.lazersport.com/global/helmets/on-road/genesis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lazer Genesis</a> helmet in orange, which happens to be my color of choice for the darker fall and winter period of the year.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/52/gallery/lazer-genesis-8.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/52/gallery/lazer-genesis-8-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Lazer Genesis in Orange.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Lazer Genesis in Orange.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/52/gallery/lazer-genesis-7.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/52/gallery/lazer-genesis-7-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Lazer Genesis in Chrome.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Lazer Genesis in Chrome.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/52/gallery/lazer-genesis-6.jpg\" data-size=\"3515x2028\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/52/gallery/lazer-genesis-6-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Lazer Genesis in Orange.\" width=\"720\" height=\"415\"></a>\n<figcaption>Lazer Genesis in Orange.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/52/gallery/lazer-genesis-5.jpg\" data-size=\"3637x2127\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/52/gallery/lazer-genesis-5-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Lazer Genesis in Chrome and Orange.\" width=\"720\" height=\"421\"></a>\n<figcaption>Lazer Genesis in Chrome and Orange.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>After a few rides with the Genesis, I decided to get a second one in a more neutral color. I found another discontinued color; the 2021 LTD Chrome Black Edition. Otherwise, I would have waited until spring and gone with the 2022 <a href=\"https://www.lazersport.com/global/helmets/on-road/genesis-blue-haze-limited-edition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blue Haze Limited Edition</a>. Chrome/black is not as neutral as matte black or matte titanium. It stands out within the wide range of road cycling helmets in that chrome finish. Something different for sure. So, hopefully, I’m set for the next five or more years with these two helmets.</p>",

Everything felt sluggish about them. Out of the saddle, it felt like fighting the wheels. On rough road surfaces, the narrower tires with 0.5 bar more pressure than what I run the 650Bs, felt considerably harder. Downhills and flat stretches of road were fine. It took a few more rides to adjust to the larger wheels, and climbing no longer feels as strange. The WTB Nano tires stayed airtight. They roll surprisingly well on pavement and are an absolute blast on gravel. Now that I have them on the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/\">Nordest Albarda</a>, I’ve been including more gravel into my rides. Autumn, in my opinion, is far nicer for gravel riding as gravel roads don’t have that looseness and dust that they suffer from during the summer months. The extra moisture in the air makes gravel roads much faster, and the lower temperatures probably too.</p>\n<p>A quick update on the <a href=\"#non-existing-post-with-id-46\">Stooge MK5</a> project: While I had no difficulties finding all the components needed for the bike, Andy couldn’t get the framesets on the first boat leaving Asia. Getting goods on cargo ships these days isn’t easy and has become increasingly expensive. I work for a machine tool company that gets its machines from Japan. To ship one of our \"<a href=\"https://english.mazak.jp/machines/integrex-i-250h-st/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bread and butter</a>\" machines to Europe can easily cost up to 150’000.00 Euros or more. We used to pay about 30’000 Euros pre-pandemic. Whether it’s bike frames, machines, or diapers, moving goods across the globe has become extremely expensive. It may ultimately be a good thing as we have to rethink the working of our economies in the face of climate change. But in the short term, it poses all sorts of problems. But back to the MK5. The framesets arrived at <a href=\"http://stoogecycles.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stooge HQ</a> in the UK and should be mailed to all those who pre-ordered very soon.</p>",

This 4500-lumen front light mounts smack in the front center of my stem, thanks to a Garmin-style <a href=\"https://magicshine.com/products/magicshine%C2%AE-mj-6272-out-front-bike-mount\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MJ-6272</a> front mount.

It is going to shield the battery from the elements and the cold. When I returned from my last two rides, dusk started to set in while coming down the mountain. I still saw plenty but will be using the light from now on to be seen by the occasional driver that may come up the road. On my narrow roads in the woods, an un-illuminated cyclist can easily be missed after all. </p>",

Well, this isn't the place for a great wheel debate, as I believe that every wheel and tire size has its merits. It's all about the rider, his or her skills, intended use, and the terrain the bike will see. I've been on 26\" wheels since 1986, 29ers since <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/250774966\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2006</a>, and fat-bikes since <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/8540578613\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2013</a> (first 26, then 27.5). For a brief period around the turn of the century, I rode <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/21309654772\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hardtails</a> with front suspension, but before and after, I mountain-biked on <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/5542561458\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rigid bikes</a>. My trails generally offer little flow and little speed. They tend to be tight, tricky, and have to be ridden more slowly than fast. While I can maneuver a 29er on such trails just fine, an agile 27.5+ will probably be even more fun to navigate.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1913x2236\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The front wheel.\" width=\"720\" height=\"842\"></a>\n<figcaption>The front wheel.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-02.jpg\" data-size=\"2562x2202\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The rear wheel.\" width=\"720\" height=\"619\"></a>\n<figcaption>The rear wheel.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-03.jpg\" data-size=\"3570x2942\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Rear Onyx Boost hub.\" width=\"720\" height=\"593\"></a>\n<figcaption>Rear Onyx Boost hub.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-04.jpg\" data-size=\"3587x2690\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Rear Onyx Boost hub.\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Rear Onyx Boost hub.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The steeper terrain heavily influenced the choice of brakes. XC brakes would be overwhelmed with the steep descents, so I opted for the same brakes as on my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">Snakedriver</a>; a pair of 4 piston Formula Cura 4 brakes. And to give them yet more power, I matched them up with a 203mm front and a 180mm rear rotor. Most riders would equip their bikes with a dropper. I have one on my fat bike and wouldn't want to miss it on winter rides in the snow. But for every other bike I've owned, I have not used adjustable seat posts, and I'm fine with that pretty much everywhere I ride. So, to keep the Stooge MK5 simple and low maintenance, I'll push a dead gorgeous Thomson Masterpiece into the seat tube.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-05.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Formula Cura 4 brakes.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Formula Cura 4 brakes.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-06.jpg\" data-size=\"2696x2081\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Bolts and small parts.\" width=\"720\" height=\"556\"></a>\n<figcaption>Bolts and small parts.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-07.jpg\" data-size=\"3197x2350\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Bearings and small bits.\" width=\"720\" height=\"529\"></a>\n<figcaption>Bearings and small bits.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-08.jpg\" data-size=\"3948x2104\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-08-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Ritchey Comp Kyote bar.\" width=\"720\" height=\"384\"></a>\n<figcaption>Ritchey Comp Kyote bar.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The wheels were built by local frame builder and lacing wizard Patrik Widmer of <a href=\"https://www.47grad-nord.ch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">47° Nord</a>.

It is mated to a jaw-droppingly sweet Enve aluminum stem. Lastly, a new and untested Prologo Scratch M5 saddle towers on top of the seat post. After years riding various models of Fizik Antares saddles, I switched to Prologo for my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/\">Nordest Albarda</a>. The short-nosed Dimension Nack on that bike feels great. In my humble opinion, an open saddle doesn't belong on a mountain bike nor any bike ridden in the mud. Hence the decision to try out Prologo's Scratch. If the Scratch and my derrière become friends, the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-sl/\">Volagi Viaje</a> and <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">44 Snakedriver</a> will get one too.</p>",

One has to be patient, shop globally, and sometimes just go for available components. While I have always been using 180 mm rotors on the front of my mountain bikes and 160 mm in the back, I'm going a size larger on the <a href=\"#non-existing-post-with-id-46\">Stooge MK5</a>. My favorite Centerlock rotor, TRP's TR-25 was easily sourced in 203 mm diameter. 180 mm though, was nowhere to be found in Europe. I had to order that size from Universal Cycles in the US.

The Onyx Boost hubs had a lead time of 5-6 weeks and arrived as promised. Due to the supply shortages, one would expect prices to be up or at least not to be marked down, but I was able to get two pairs of tires at heavily reduced prices. All I'm missing now is a set of disc brakes. In keeping with standardizing the components across my bikes, the MK5 has to be equipped with the same brakes as my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">44 Snakedriver</a> - Formula Cura 4. They had been stock in most online shops up to a couple of weeks ago.

That has changed in 2021. Last summer I sold my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157632954649710\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">44 Big Boy</a> fat-bike, which had become my geared trail bike. It was just as a fun bike on dirt as it had been on snow, but after we moved eastwards along the \"Jurasüdfuss\", it became clear that it wasn't the ideal bike for the trails to the north of our new home. Hence the decision to sell it. It found a new owner in the country it was built and is now <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CLQLVG2A6Zeimm3wTEHhlGASJHCHcj3qmV18So0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">roaming across trails</a> in the great state of Wisconsin. I kept following what Andy made with Stooge and was excited to read that an MK5 was in the pipeline.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://stoogecycles.co.uk/product/mk5-coming-soon-ish/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MK5</a> is a different beast from the MK4. Although Andy has never been a huge fan of boost axles, the market has sort of forced him to adopt the de facto axle standard. The MK5 now has boost spacing front and back. It lost the huge fork offset of the MK4 and now shares the same 57 mm offset bi-plane fork as the previously released Scrambler. Just like the <a href=\"http://stoogecycles.co.uk/2020/05/30/coming-soon-the-stooge-scrambler/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scrambler</a>, it's equipped with tons of rack and bottle mounting options, so that you can bike-pack this purebred trail-ripper. While you can set it up with 29×3 front/29×2.5-2.6 rear, the MK5 is designed for 27.5x3.0 front and rear, which is exactly the wheel and tire size I wanted to use. Yeah, I know, the trend in mountain biking is currently 29\" and tires have come back to sizes in the 2.4 to 2.6 range. 2.8 and 3.0 still exist while 3.25 is almost extinct. Well, I can care less what the current trend is. If I were, I wouldn't be buying a rigid steel bike, now, would I?</p>\n<p>I'm also stoked that the MK5 will come in <a href=\"http://stoogecycles.co.uk/product/mk5-18-brown-pre-order-deposit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brown</a>, Pantone <a href=\"https://icolorpalette.com/color/pantone-147-c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">147C</a> to be precise. I've been wanting to own a brown bike forever. If there aren't any unforeseen manufacturing or shipping delays, the ETA should be August 2021. I've got a pretty good idea of how I want to equip the bike, so time has come to place orders to get all the necessary components by the time the frameset arrives. The plan is to strike a good balance between quality and affordability - good parts but within a budget. I have a few bits and pieces already, I've ordered two pairs of 27.5x3.0 tires and need to get hubs and rims next. So, stay tuned for the build progress. Pandemic and all, I'm not setting a timeline on it. It'll be done when it'll be done. I'm lucky to have plenty of other bikes to ride in the meantime. </p>\n<p>All image credits: <a href=\"http://stoogecycles.co.uk/2019/02/28/a-short-history-of-steel-stooge-framesets-and-everything-in-between/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stooge Cycles</a>.</p>",

Not just when going downhill, but when climbing as well. When riding up a climb out of the saddle, it always seemed like the 700C front wheel was working against me. After putting 650B wheels on the bike, that feeling is gone. The bike now is a better extension of myself when motoring up a climb out of the saddle.</p>\n",

But for the last two years, I rode my latest bike, my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/\">Nordest Albarda</a>, on a set of 700C wheels. Such wheels roll well, but they don't like to change direction as quickly as a smaller 650B wheel. I like a bike to be lively and agile. Directional stability can have its advantages, but I generally prefer quick, sharp steering. Switching my Albarda to smaller wheels, instantly gave me that. The bike is so much more fun to ride. Not just when going downhill, but when climbing as well. When riding up a climb out of the saddle, it always seemed like the 700C front wheel was working against me. After putting 650B wheels on the bike, that feeling is gone. The bike now is a better extension of myself when motoring up a climb out of the saddle.</p>\n\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/45/gallery/albarda-650b-1.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/45/gallery/albarda-650b-1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Montagne de Romont on on May 14, 2021.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Montagne de Romont.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/45/gallery/albarda-650b-2.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/45/gallery/albarda-650b-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Along the Suze back to Frinvillier.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Along the Suze.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/45/gallery/albarda-650b-3.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/45/gallery/albarda-650b-3-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Grenchenberg on on May 12, 2021.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Grenchenberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>At speed, the wheels and wider tires are an absolute treat. They smooth out everything. Rather than feeling road vibrations, it feels like sitting aboard a hovercraft. Most riders equate vibrations with speed. Narrow, hard tires transmit all the road chatter to the rider. So, when we feel the road more, we believe that we're going faster, even if the speedometer says otherwise. Separate your body from such vibrations, and you suddenly think that you aren't all that fast, even if the speedometer may say otherwise. I have yet to put enough miles on the bike to figure out how the 650B wheels affect my average speed. And this year isn't representative anyway. I'm unable to train nor rest as much as in the past.</p>\n<p>I was probably one of the first Swiss riders to move from 26\" to 29\" wheels in 2006. I lived still in the US when I bought <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157594265939262\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my first 29er</a> but had already set things in motion to move back to Switzerland. I was long an advocate of the \"<a href=\"https://www.strava.com/clubs/twentyniner-ch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bigger is better</a>\" movement. Interestingly, now that the 29\" wheel has become the de facto standard from XC to downhill, I find myself moving away from the trend. I own two 650B road bikes, a 27.5\" fat-bike and I just put a down payment on a 27.5\" mountain bike. There are some interesting months ahead, as I need to shop for components. The frameset should be arriving sometime in August.</p>",

To put it into a turn requires therefore a more forceful steering input. This, I think, can be changed somewhat by reducing the diameter of the wheels. At least that's what happened with the Volagi, which is very agile, to begin with. In fact, with 650B wheels, that bike tends to oversteer. The Albarda should therefore improve in steerability. It was therefore long on my wishlist to equip the bike with a fast set of 650B wheels. Right at the beginning of the year, I set things in motion by ordering a pair of <a href=\"https://www.lightbicycle.com/650b-road-bicycle-rims-32mm-wide-35mm-deep-symmetric-clincher-road-disc-brake-available.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Light Bicycle WR35</a> gravel rims. These are 25mm internal, 32mm external hooked carbon rims with a nice 35mm deep aero profile. At the same time, I ordered a pair of Chris King R45D thru-axle Centerlock hubs from my trusted wheel builder, <a href=\"https://www.47grad-nord.ch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">47° Nord</a>. The hubs arrived at the end of March; the rims arrived in April. Black Sapim CX-Ray spokes and red DT Swiss nipples, 24 per wheel, complete the wheels.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Original setup</span>:\n<ul>\n<li>Nox Citico wheels with Chris King R45D hubs</li>\n<li>René Herse 700C x 38 <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/700c/700cx38-barlow-pass/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Barlow Pass</a> tires (40mm actual measurement)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">New setup</span>:\n<ul>\n<li>47° Nord wheels with Chris King R45D hubs and Light Bicycle WR35 carbon rims</li>\n<li>René Herse 650B x 48 <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/650b/650bx48-switchback-hill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Switchback Hill</a> tires</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Alternative setup</span>:\n<ul>\n<li>Nox Citico 700C wheels with Chris King R45D hubs</li>\n<li>René Herse 700C x 44 <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/700c/700cx44-snoqualmie-pass/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snoqualmie Pass</a> tires</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All tubeless of course.
