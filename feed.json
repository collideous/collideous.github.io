But then Andy Stevenson designed the <a href=\"http://stoogecycles.co.uk/product/mk5-18-swamp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stooge MK5</a> around 27.5+ tires. Although this tire size reached its apotheosis in 2015 and 2016 and has all but died, I think 27.5 plus tires still have their merits. Cycling is a fashion industry, and currently, 29-inch wheels are fashionable. I remember the days when many called them a fad. For a long time, the downhill-oriented crowd within the mountain bike community never wanted to touch these big wheels. Now, practically everyone sits on 29\" wheels. It's a wheel size that inspires confidence. It rolls over stuff easily. 27.5\" is the fun-sized wheel size. I'd say the same for gravel and road, where I find 650B more agile and fun than 700C. In the 27.5x3.0 size, tire diameter is almost identical to a 29x2.2. Choices may make this sport confusing to the beginner trying to find the right bike, but options are awesome for the experienced rider who can build the perfect bike to match his skills and his playground.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/46/gallery/stooge-mk5-5.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/46/gallery/stooge-mk5-5-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The drivetrain.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>The drivetrain.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/46/gallery/stooge-mk5-6.jpg\" data-size=\"3137x2738\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/46/gallery/stooge-mk5-6-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Formula Cura 4.\" width=\"720\" height=\"628\"></a>\n<figcaption>Formula Cura 4.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/46/gallery/stooge-mk5-7.jpg\" data-size=\"3563x2200\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/46/gallery/stooge-mk5-7-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Those bars.\" width=\"720\" height=\"445\"></a>\n<figcaption>Those bars.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/46/gallery/stooge-mk5-8.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/46/gallery/stooge-mk5-8-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"My own BB.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>My own BB.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Once spring and summer have passed, and I've had plenty of time on the MK5, I'll return to this post to write about how the bike performs on my local trails.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-color: #7e8c8d; border-style: solid; width: 100%; height: 1300px;\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #ced4d9;\">\n<th colspan=\"3\">Info</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>First Ride</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">March 5th, 2022</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bike Weight</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">12.68 kg</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame Size</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\"><a href=\"https://bikeinsights.com/bikes/6095bd46681ed40022fc6af0-stooge-cycles-mk5?version=2021&amp;build=base\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">18\"</a> (detailed <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/stooge-mk5-geometry/\">geometry</a>)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame Color</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Swamp (Pantone 147C)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Mileage</td>\n<td colspan=\"2\">0,000 km</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #ced4d9;\">\n<th colspan=\"3\">Components</th>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #ecf0f1;\">\n<th>Type</th>\n<th>Brand</th>\n<th>Model</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Frame</td>\n<td>Stooge</td>\n<td>MK5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Fork</td>\n<td>Stooge</td>\n<td>MK5, Bi-Plane</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Handlebar</td>\n<td>Ritchey</td>\n<td>Kyote</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brakes</td>\n<td>Formula</td>\n<td>Cura 4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Seatpost</td>\n<td>Thomson</td>\n<td>Masterpiece</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stem</td>\n<td>Enve</td>\n<td>Aluminum</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Headset</td>\n<td>Cane Creek</td>\n<td>110</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Wheels</td>\n<td>47° Nord</td>\n<td>LB AM740 Rims, Onyx Boost Hubs</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Pedals</td>\n<td>Crank Brothers</td>\n<td>Eggbeater 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Tires</td>\n<td>Schwalbe</td>\n<td>Nobby Nic 27.5x3.0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Saddle</td>\n<td>Prologo</td>\n<td>Scratch M5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brake Rotors</td>\n<td>TRP</td>\n<td>TRP-25, 203/180mm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Bottom Bracket</td>\n<td>GestaltDesign</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/the-nuts-and-bolts-of-bb3106/\">BB3016</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Crankset</td>\n<td>Rotor</td>\n<td>Kapic, 175mm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chainring</td>\n<td>Rotor</td>\n<td>QX1, 30T</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Chain</td>\n<td>SRAM</td>\n<td>XX1 Eagle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Cassette</td>\n<td>SRAM</td>\n<td>XG-1299 Eagle</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Derailleur</td>\n<td>SRAM</td>\n<td>GX Eagle AXS with MPM Tech pulley cage</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

Unless you have the space and the disposable income to set up your own small workshop equipped with a lathe and a mill, preferably CNC, making parts like my BB3106 is sadly out of reach for most, even if you have the professional background like myself to design them. If you don't own the necessary machines, you can only get something like this made if you know someone who will do you a favor to do the machining or if you know how to operate the machines, lets you use their shop. It's basically impossible to find a machine shop that will take the time to machine a single workpiece or even a few. And if a shop would do it, you would probably immediately drop the idea as soon as you'd see the quote. Your jaw will probably drop looking at the price table below.</p>\n<p>While I often have ideas swirling around my brain for some clever bicycle component - and I've probably had hundreds in all the years I've been riding - most often, these ideas stay just that, a fun daydream while riding. As a trained machine mechanic and graduate mechanical engineer, I know how to design and make stuff. But because I don't have the machines to make any of it, nor good connections to a CNC shop, I often don't even bother putting any of these ideas on paper. In the case of the BB3106, the guys in our applications department did me a favor and machined the bottom bracket on a CNC lathe in our demo room. They ended up with four scrap parts until the tooling was perfectly dialed to machine three good bottom brackets. All in all, it was a full day's work. A CNC shop generally has various chucks they can put on a lathe and has drawers full of turning tools. They won’t have a day, but they will still have a considerable setup time. If you had to pay real-world shop hours, you wouldn't be able to afford such a bottom bracket. That's why it's extremely rare for me to undertake such a project. Let's go through the nuts and bolts of the project:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Design</span><br>The function the item has to perform dictates the design. So do the elements that mate with the BB. The frame has a 54.7mm ID bottom bracket shell with a width of 73mm. The axle I'm using is a 30mm <a href=\"https://rotorbike.com/catalog/default/kapic-axle.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rotor Boost axle</a>. So, there's that. The rest is dictated by the bearings I'm using and by the chain line.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Materials</span><br>The BB3106 is machined out of <a href=\"https://www.impol.com/app/uploads/2020/07/Aluminium-alloy-EN-AW-6026.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">EN AW-6026</a> aluminum, an alloy renowned for good machining characteristics and excellent anodizing response. I bought <a href=\"https://www.enduroforkseals.com/products/wheels-and-brakes/wheel-bearings-individual/angular-contact-cartridge/440c_abec5_ac/S71806-LLB.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Enduro S71806 440C</a> stainless angular contact bearings and two <a href=\"https://www.bike24.com/p2283482.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">SKF 61806 2RS1 MTRX10</a> solid oil bearings. Two bearing seals provide extra protection. To clamp the BB, I use stainless flat-faced ball-ended setscrews and a pair of replaceable brass shims so that the setscrews can't gouge the BB3106.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Machining</span><br>I work for a <a href=\"https://www.wenk-ag.ch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">company</a> that sells CNC machines. We always have a few in our demo room. While I used to use CNC machines during my apprenticeship more than 30 years ago, I haven't been trained to operate the modern machines we sell. It's just not part of my job. Our applications guys made the part for me on one of the CNC lathes in our exposition room. It was quite a challenge as our tooling selection is limited and we only have the standard factory-equipped chucks, but they got it done.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Anodizing</span><br>I'm lucky to live in a highly industrial area, where surface finishing companies are plentiful. I don't even have to leave town to have something <a href=\"http://www.swiss-pvd-coating.ch/en/coatings/tin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">titanium-nitride coated</a> or to get something <a href=\"https://www.ghg.ch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">anodized</a>. With small quantities, such as my bottom bracket or the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/44767756895\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">head badge</a> for my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">Snakedriver</a>, you just have to be patient until the surface finisher has some larger job, where they can add your parts.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Assembly</span><br>The assembly of the BB3106 is the last and easiest step; press one bearing in on one side, then do the same with the other. A bit of grease helps the process. Lightly grease the Boost axle and push it through the bearings, not forgetting the outer bearing seal.</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">The Cost</span><br>The parts and raw materials are easy to calculate. For machining, I paid nothing other than lunch for two applications technicians. If I put the CNC shop hour at CHF 200.00 for such prototype work and they need 6 hours, machining the BB3106 would cost CHF 1'200.00. That's likely not an exaggeration, quite possibly in fact, it's even at the low end of it here in Switzerland.<br>\n<table class=\"align-left\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #ecf0f1;\">\n<td> </td>\n<td class=\"align-right\"><strong>Effective</strong></td>\n<td class=\"align-right\"><strong>Shop Made </strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Enduro stainless angular contact bearings</td>\n<td class=\"align-right\">CHF 60.00</td>\n<td class=\"align-right\">CHF 60.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>60mm diameter aluminum bar stock</td>\n<td class=\"align-right\">CHF 86.00</td>\n<td class=\"align-right\">CHF 86.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Enduro Bearings bottom bracket seals</td>\n<td class=\"align-right\">CHF 9.00</td>\n<td class=\"align-right\">CHF 9.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Brass shims (pack of 50)</td>\n<td class=\"align-right\">CHF 8.00</td>\n<td class=\"align-right\">CHF 8.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Stainless flat-faced ball-ended setscrews</td>\n<td class=\"align-right\">CHF 12.00</td>\n<td class=\"align-right\">CHF 12.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Machining (pure estimate for shop-made)</td>\n<td class=\"align-right\">CHF 35.00</td>\n<td class=\"align-right\">CHF 1200.00</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Black anodizing</td>\n<td class=\"align-right\">CHF 97.00</td>\n<td class=\"align-right\">CHF 97.00</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n<tfoot>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #ecf0f1;\">\n<td><strong>Total</strong></td>\n<td class=\"align-right\"><strong>CHF 307.00</strong></td>\n<td class=\"align-right\"><strong>CHF 1472.00 </strong></td>\n</tr>\n</tfoot>\n</table>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, it's easy to see that custom parts, such as this bottom bracket, are out of reach for the casual component designer, who needs a CNC shop to have an idea realized. This BB3106 wouldn't exist if I had to put a 1500 franc hole into my wallet.</p>",

            "summary": "<p>If there's one thing I would change about the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/stooge-mk5/\">Stooge MK5</a>, it's the eccentric bottom bracket. With a 1x12 drivetrain, I simply don't need it. I acknowledge that there are benefits to having one. For one, the MK5 can be set up single-speed or geared. As such, it has a wider appeal, and should I ever part with it, the circle of potential buyers would be considerably larger. My experiences with the two EBB-equipped bikes I've owned, however, were more bad than good. My <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157594265939262\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Niner One9</a>, for instance, had a setscrew EBB. The setscrews quickly ate themselves into the EBB, and the BB shell ovalized over time, leaving a wide gap between the shell and the EBB. The gap filled with dirt, and the whole setup was creaking more often than not. My <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157624709981871\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Air9 Carbon</a> came with Niner's own <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/5007770051/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bio-Centric</a> bottom bracket, a design that clamps to the outside faces of the EBB shell. In theory, this seemed great. Machine a precise cylindrical BB shell with parallel outside faces and clamp two eccentric cups against those faces. In practice, it was pretty shitty, to say the least. For one, machining tolerances were such that a Bio-Centric cup would more easily turn on one side of the shell than on the other. But much worse was that Niner designed large cutouts into the shell so that shifter cables could be routed internally.

            "content_html": "<p>If there's one thing I would change about the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/stooge-mk5/\">Stooge MK5</a>, it's the eccentric bottom bracket. With a 1x12 drivetrain, I simply don't need it. I acknowledge that there are benefits to having one. For one, the MK5 can be set up single-speed or geared. As such, it has a wider appeal, and should I ever part with it, the circle of potential buyers would be considerably larger. My experiences with the two EBB-equipped bikes I've owned, however, were more bad than good. My <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157594265939262\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Niner One9</a>, for instance, had a setscrew EBB. The setscrews quickly ate themselves into the EBB, and the BB shell ovalized over time, leaving a wide gap between the shell and the EBB. The gap filled with dirt, and the whole setup was creaking more often than not. My <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157624709981871\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Air9 Carbon</a> came with Niner's own <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/5007770051/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bio-Centric</a> bottom bracket, a design that clamps to the outside faces of the EBB shell. In theory, this seemed great. Machine a precise cylindrical BB shell with parallel outside faces and clamp two eccentric cups against those faces. In practice, it was pretty shitty, to say the least. For one, machining tolerances were such that a Bio-Centric cup would more easily turn on one side of the shell than on the other. But much worse was that Niner designed large cutouts into the shell so that shifter cables could be routed internally. This dramatically weakened the shell to the point that the proper tightening torque of the Bio-Centric was enough to crush it. It was an extremely troublesome design that creaked a lot as well.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/gallery/bb3106-1.jpg\" data-size=\"3491x1964\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/gallery/bb3106-1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Machining the new bottom bracket.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Machining.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/gallery/bb3106-2.jpg\" data-size=\"3491x2618\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/gallery/bb3106-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Made on a Mazak CNC lathe.\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Mazak CNC lathe.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/gallery/bb3106-3.jpg\" data-size=\"3491x1964\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/gallery/bb3106-3-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"First fit test with a sample piece.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>First fit test.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/gallery/bb3106-4.jpg\" data-size=\"1536x1536\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/gallery/bb3106-4-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The finished BB3106 fresh out of the shop.\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\"></a>\n<figcaption>Finished BB3106.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/gallery/bb3016-5.jpg\" data-size=\"3491x1964\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/gallery/bb3016-5-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Fit check with axle and crank.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Fit check.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/gallery/bb3106-6.jpg\" data-size=\"3089x1996\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/gallery/bb3106-6-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The massive non-drive side.\" width=\"720\" height=\"465\"></a>\n<figcaption>Non-drive side.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>So, one could think that I wouldn't touch a bike with an eccentric BB with a ten-foot pole, but when you're looking for a rigid, non-suspension corrected bike, the options are pretty small. And, I love every other aspect of the MK5. Besides, it's steel and should therefore have a much stronger BB shell. The BB shells of the two Niners I owned were both aluminum. The ovalizing seen on the One9 should not happen to a steel shell, IMHO. Since I'm not running this bike single-speed, there's no need for an eccentric BB. So I thought, why not design my own CBB (concentric bottom bracket) and simplify this central part of the bike in the process? The standard setup requires the EBB insert, two setscrews, two external bottom bracket cups, and depending on your crankset axle, various amounts of spacers. Designing my own CBB, I can get rid of the BB cups by using a CBB insert that holds two bearings. Design it to the exact width of the Rotor Boost axle, and I can get rid of the axle spacers, too. To avoid munching up the CBB shell, I'm using two stainless flat-faced ball-ended setscrews, which press onto replaceable brass shims. Being concentric and manufactured to a tighter tolerance, I should also be able to tighten the setscrews with less torque. Riding the hell out of it will tell if the design is any good.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/bb3106-5.png\" sizes=\"100vw\" srcset=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/responsive/bb3106-5-xs.png 300w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/responsive/bb3106-5-sm.png 480w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/responsive/bb3106-5-md.png 768w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/responsive/bb3106-5-lg.png 1024w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/responsive/bb3106-5-xl.png 1360w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/53/responsive/bb3106-5-2xl.png 1600w\"  alt=\"BB3016 CAD Drawing.\" width=\"1482\" height=\"754\"></figure>\n<p>Since the bottom bracket is a design of my own, it doesn't follow any current bike standards. If you will, it's a new standard that I developed specifically for Rotor Kapic cranks with Boost axle mounted to a <a href=\"http://stoogecycles.co.uk/product/mk5-18-swamp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stooge MK5</a> frame. It will not fit any other cranks. Every new standard needs a designation. CBB30 was a thought. Or referencing axle diameter and BB width, such as BB386 or BB392 do, it could be called BB3106. BB3106, that's right. Remember that you saw it here first!</p>",

At the moment, they’re very needed since a lot of the trails have ice on them.</p>\nYesterday, I decided to visit the Bözingenberg. The northern side of it, as well as the whole valley of Vauffelin, don’t see much sun during these months. The other weekend, when I drove to les Prés d’Orvin, for instance, it was -10ºC in Vauffelin while it was about +1ºC in Prés d’Orvin. Sure enough, I spent the whole way on snow. Crossing the Bözingenberg west to east brought ever-changing snow conditions. South-western facing slopes were often slushy. Flatter, sun-exposed patches often had no or little snow. Eastern facing slopes or wooded areas were all still covered with crunchy snow. Speaking of studs, the last mile to get home I pop onto the Grenchenberg road. Going downhill and entering Grenchen I arrive with quite some speed. Fat-bike tires with huge knobs are loud, to begin with, add metals studs, and you’re likely the loudest vehicle that comes down the hill all day. Not surprisingly, every pedestrian on the sidewalk turns around to see what’s approaching.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"5\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/61/gallery/fatbiking-little-1.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/61/gallery/fatbiking-little-1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Following the footpaths of hikers.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Footpaths.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/61/gallery/fatbiking-little-2.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/61/gallery/fatbiking-little-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Climbing one of my favorite trails.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Bözingenberg climb.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/61/gallery/fatbiking-little-3.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/61/gallery/fatbiking-little-3-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Some great snow still up there.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Great snow.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/61/gallery/fatbiking-little-4.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/61/gallery/fatbiking-little-4-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Enjoying the afternoon sun.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Afternoon sun.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/61/gallery/fatbiking-little-5.jpg\" data-size=\"3491x2618\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/61/gallery/fatbiking-little-5-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Kein Feuer Machen.

The small <a href=\"https://www.chuwi.com/product/items/Chuwi-LarkBox.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Chuwi Larkbox</a> mini PC I bought in the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/finally-a-new-pc-on-my-desk/\">fall of 2020</a> has been giving me trouble the past couple of months. When it started, I decided to backup everything to the cloud. I reinstalled Windows a couple of times, which temporarily fixed the problems, but they became more frequent, and now the unit seems toast. Although the Larkbox had a small internal fan, I think heat management may have been the issue that led to its failure. While I now do most things on my MacBook, like typing this post, there are a few things for which software on Windows is easier to find. Since I don’t need a powerful nor expensive PC, I decided to buy a 2.8” mini PC under the name \"<a href=\"https://liliputing.com/2022/01/this-2-8-inch-mini-pc-has-an-intel-celeron-n5105-processor-dual-hdmi-ports.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ZX01</a>\". This PC is equipped with a much newer generation of processor than the <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/128989/intel-celeron-j4105-processor-4m-cache-up-to-2-50-ghz/specifications.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">J4105</a> of the Larkbox, an Intel Celeron <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/sku/212328/intel-celeron-processor-n5105-4m-cache-up-to-2-90-ghz/specifications.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">N5105</a> Jasper Lake. The ZX01 is slightly larger, has two HDMI ports, and hopefully better cooling. It’s somewhat a mystery who the manufacturer behind it is. The ZX01 is primarily sold through <a href=\"https://www.aliexpress.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AliExpress</a>, which I have been using more and more frequently. Need titanium bolts for your bike? Check AliExpress. Need PC accessories or other electronics? Check AliExpress. Often, you find the same things that Swiss vendors sell in their online shops for a third of the price or even less. I’m taking a bit of a risk with a nice-looking mini PC, with good specs but unknown origin. I also bought a 2.5” hard drive enclosure for a few bucks. It’s for an old drive that sits inside of an enclosure with Firewire ports. Remember Firewire? Lastly, I got a small USB enclosure for the M.2 2242 SSD I pulled out of my Chuwi Larkbox. Cost? 12 bucks including shipping.</p>",

Strava is very fitness and competition-driven in the way it presents data. Power, speed, calories, energy, and heart rate to see how you did on a particular ride. There are <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/challenges\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">challenges</a> and segment <a href=\"https://support.strava.com/hc/en-us/articles/216919507-Segment-Leaderboard-Guidelines\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">leaderboards</a> to see how you perform against others. In the data, there’s a ton of information Strava doesn’t present to you, though. The scatter charts on my new dashboard page answer a few silly things around speed. So without further ado, here are a few things all my Strava activities say about me as it relates to speed on the bike:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My fastest year on Strava was 2010 for overall average speed.</li>\n<li>I dive-bombed like a Stuka in 2021.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>I cycle fastest in July, closely followed by September and June.</li>\n<li>The power to push the pedals hard evaporates in the heat of August.</li>\n<li>I can barely overtake a snowman in January.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>I generally haul ass on Wednesdays.</li>\n<li>I don’t know how to use my brakes on Mondays.</li>\n<li>Fine dinners and hearty breakfasts are boat anchors on weekends.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>My fastest bike is my stainless steel <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/ritte-snob-disc/\">Ritte</a>.</li>\n<li>My slowest bike is my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">44 Snakedriver</a> fat-bike.</li>\n</ul>",

There’s not a lot of software I need; Edge to browse, Spark to read mail, Photos for my large photo library, Atom, and Publii to maintain this blog, Office 365 and OneDrive, music players such as Sonos, Spotify, and IINA to listen to music. I have to say, macOS Monterey is a wonderful OS.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/59/gallery/late-afternoon-fatbike-ride-1.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/59/gallery/late-afternoon-fatbike-ride-1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"What a day.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>What a day.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/59/gallery/late-afternoon-fatbike-ride-2.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/59/gallery/late-afternoon-fatbike-ride-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Following snowmobile tracks.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Snowmobile tracks.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/59/gallery/late-afternoon-fatbike-ride-3.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/59/gallery/late-afternoon-fatbike-ride-3-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Climbing a white gravel road.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Climbing.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/59/gallery/late-afternoon-fatbike-ride-4.jpg\" data-size=\"3325x1870\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/59/gallery/late-afternoon-fatbike-ride-4-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Now those are some wrinkles.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Tire wrinkles.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/59/gallery/late-afternoon-fatbike-ride-5.jpg\" data-size=\"3619x2036\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/59/gallery/late-afternoon-fatbike-ride-5-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"It's getting late.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Sun setting.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/59/gallery/late-afternoon-fatbike-ride-6.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/59/gallery/late-afternoon-fatbike-ride-6-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Some sweet fat-biking trail.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>One sweet trail.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>My wife and I have been using Google’s free G Suite for our web domain, which we have had when she did some freelance graphic design. In the years since we’ve only used the domain name for our email addresses but kept it with G Suite. At work, for instance, I access my email using Google mail in the web browser. The free G Suite is <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/01/19/g-suite-legacy-free-edition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coming to an end</a> and anyone using it will have to move to a paid Workspace subscription. For the two of us that would be $12.00 per month or $144.00 a year. That in of itself is not much and Workspace offers a lot, but when one adds it to all the other paid subscriptions, it adds up to a considerable amount of cash. Since we’re already paying for Office 365 and iCloud, we’ve decided to say goodbye to Google. Since I still need Google for a few small things, I created a new Gmail account. I moved a Google sheet with a log of my Strava rides to that account and recreated my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/strava-dashboard-in-data-studio/\">Data Studio dashboard</a> under that new account. I also gave my MacBook a bit of work to do by moving all my archived emails out of Google and into iCloud. We’ll be moving our email domain to iCloud+. I cleaned up Google Drive and moved what I wanted to keep to OneDrive. The Office 365 subscription comes with 1 TB of storage after all. I’m ready to flip the switch. Now my wife will have to sort through her mail and move things to iCloud, and we can kill our G Suite account.</p>\n<p>With me busy on the computer and my wife sleeping in, it got late for a fat-bike ride. I contemplated loading the bike in the car and driving somewhere, but any minute spent in the car is a minute wasted that could be spent on the bike. So, although all the snow around the house has melted, I knew that I didn’t have to ride far to find some. To my biggest surprise, the gravel roads through our forests at a bit more elevation are completely white. To gain altitude quickly, I took a steep trail that is tough to ride without snow. I did fine at first, but further up the trail was a little more exposed to the sun, which softened the snow enough to make it nearly unclimbable. I didn’t mind the occasional hike. I gained elevation and didn’t have to take my studded tires onto pavement. I did a nice loop from the Romontberg to Plagne and back, riding lots of snowshoe trails and snowmobile tracks. Back at the Romontberg, I decided to extend the loop by heading to the Stierenberg. There’s nice singletrack to get there and sure enough, it was an absolute blast to ride it. I don’t care too much for the trails down the Stierenberg, so I took another way back to the Romontberg. Unfortunately, that trail wasn’t rideable. It’s a short stretch when you can ride it. Stomping through the snow with nightfall approaching, it seemed endless. I would have loved to take another photo or two on the downhill, but with the sun gone and the light fading, I only cared to make it home as quickly as possible.</p>",

Well, not new New. My wife got a new MacBook Pro, and she handed me her 2016 15\" MacBook Pro with a 2.9 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor. I wiped the drive and started with a fresh 12.1 Monterey macOS. Most apps I need have been installed. One huge piece of work was merging the Photos library from my old Mac with the photos I've taken in the past 3 years. I never transferred any of the new pictures to a computer.

Since I've been riding less, I never found the need to purchase new clothes. For 2022, I decided to get a handful of new garments. I often wear a sleeveless vest, whether in the winter over a jacket or on cooler days over a short or long-sleeve jersey. <a href=\"https://www.primaleurope.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Primal Wear</a> makes two nice camo vests, one green the other black/white. I bought the green one first, and once I saw fit and quality, I also got a black/white one. In addition, I ordered a camo jersey from Primal, a green <a href=\"https://dhbsport.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DHB</a> winter jacket, and two long sleeve jerseys from <a href=\"https://www.wiggle.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wiggle</a>.

The 9 mm reach difference between MK5 and <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-marauder/\">Marauder</a> was the reason I opted for a 50 mm stem for the MK5 versus a 40 mm stem on the Marauder. It's interesting to point out that the MK5 has a shorter reach yet has a slightly longer top tube than the Marauder.</p>\n<p>One measurement I use, and one which you won't find in any manufacturer's geometry chart, is the distance from the saddle nose to the center of my palm when holding the handlebar. On the MK5 I have a short-nosed <a href=\"https://prologo.it/en/collections/marathon-xc/products/scratch-m5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prologo Scratch M5 Nack</a> saddle, so in that case, I compare not the distance from the nose but from the back of the saddle (saddle to grip in the table above). There are three points your body contacts the bike after all. Your feet stand on the pedals, your butt sits on the saddle, and your hands grab the handlebar. As already hinted before, although the Snakedriver has the longest reach, it has the shortest saddle-to-grip distance. The Marauder, the only bike with a setback seat post, is the longest. The Stooge is slightly longer than the Snakedriver, which should be good. Both bikes are geared, and I'm pedaling more in the saddle when I have 12 cogs I can shift into. The stretched position on the Marauder is ideal because it's mostly ridden out of the saddle being a single-speed.</p>\n<p>Let's move on to the head tube angles, where the Marauder has an almost old-schoolishly steep 70°. It doesn't hinder me, though, to have fun on that bike. The Snakedriver with 68° would nowadays also be considered steep. Angles have slackened quite a bit these past couple of years. The MK5 sports the slackest head tube angle with 66°. If I discover that this suits me well, the next fat-bike in a couple of years may well be designed like that as well.</p>\n<p>Let's jump a few rows down to the fork figures. Here, the MK5 stands out with the most rake (or fork offset) and the longest trail. It'll be interesting to discover the steering characteristics of the bike. The common belief has always been that more trail makes a bike more stable. And on the other end, less trail, less stability, and as a result, more agility. Jan Heine <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/trail-does-not-make-a-bike-stable/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recently experimented</a> with two bikes and noticed that the number to look at isn't trail, but wheel flop. He called wheel flop \"power steering.\" The more you have on a bike, the easier it is to turn it. The MK5 happens to have the most wheel flop. Such \"power steering\" is obviously good on technical terrain downhill. Will it be too much \"power steering\" to keep the bike in a straight line while climbing?</p>\n<p>Let's jump back up a few rows and look at the bottom bracket. Here the Marauder has the most ground clearance. The Snakedriver, which has the largest wheels, has the bottom bracket as low as the MK5. I had it designed that way. When I approached Kris to build my second fat bike, I asked him for a snow-specific geometry. It wasn't meant to be a general-purpose fat bike, and that's why we put the bottom bracket low, as you want to be as low as possible in soft snow. The BB of the MK5 is surprisingly low, too. This probably has to do with the fact, that Andy designed the bike for both 27.5\" and 29\" wheels. Since I'm using the smaller wheels the BB drops closer to the ground.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I'm ending this analysis with a look at lengths. The Marauder is the shortest bike overall, front-center, as well as in the back. The Snakedriver is unsurprisingly the longest of the three. Again, the thinking was length provides stability, and directional stability is what you want in snow or sand. The MK5 is on the long side as well.</p>",

Unfortunately, I only managed to head out for a ride on Monday, the last day of my extended weekend. On Sunday, I had my booster shot midday, which meant not enough time before the appointment, and then it was too late to head to Prés d'Orvin, which is a popular weekend destination for anyone wanting to go into the snow. On a side note, I was pretty impressed with how well organized the vaccination center was and how quickly I was in and out of there with a booster shot into my left shoulder and a new certificate in my right hand. Back to the topic; on weekends I prefer to be in Prés d'Orvin before 8AM and be done with my ride when the masses arrive. This year, I'm not able to leave this early, so I'm less inclined to drive up there. But, on a weekday like this Monday, the place isn't busy. Traffic is light, and parking is plentiful. The ski lifts were operating, but the slope wasn't busy. I decided to climb it for my first descent of the winter. The snow was great, but poor visibility due to heavy fog made descending challenging.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-4.jpg\" data-size=\"3838x1725\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-4-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Alone at the Chasseral antenna.\" width=\"720\" height=\"324\"></a>\n<figcaption>Chasseral antenna.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-5.jpg\" data-size=\"3831x1642\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-5-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The sunny view from the top of the Chasseral.\" width=\"720\" height=\"309\"></a>\n<figcaption>Top of the Chasseral.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-6.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-6-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The action starts right there.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Crest trail.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Once at the bottom, I turned west to climb towards the Place Centrale. The winter hiking trails were perfectly groomed all the way to the cross-country skiing center. From there, I had to hop on the ice-covered road for about a kilometer, until the winter hiking trail continued off to the left. The official winter hiking path, when groomed, makes a turn eastwards to bring people to the Place Centrale. To my surprise, that upper leg of the trail was missing. Fortunately for me, hordes of snowshoers had taken the straight way up the mountain on the weekend, leaving behind a perfectly rideable trail from bottom to top. I finally got out of the fog while getting up that climb. I dropped down on the northern side, rode the cross-country ski track for a few hundred meters, then took the straight way to the Métairie du Milieu de Bienne, where I hopped back on the cross-country ski track. It dropped me right off at the backside of the Chasseral. The climb to the antenna that followed wasn't rideable. It rarely is.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-7.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-7-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Leaving the Chasseral behind.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Trail fun.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-8.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-8-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"A gorgeous day to be up there.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Gorgeous day.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-9.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-9-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The trail couldn't have been better.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Ideal conditions.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The best followed at that point; the crest trail eastwards back to the Place Centrale. It was rideable all the way, even some of the challenging drops that are formed by snow accumulation. The dropper seat post comes in handy along this trail. Each time the trail drops, I lower the dropper. Each time the trail is flat or has an incline, I move the saddle back to the top. After 3 years of usage, the thing needs to be serviced, though. Most droppers aren't user-serviceable and need to be sent in for service. I hate that. This is the main reason I've never and will never own a full-suspension bike or even a hardtail. I simply don't want parts on a bike that I can't easily service myself. Because a dropper post offers some real benefits, particularly for a fat-bike ridden in snow, I have one on my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">Snakedriver</a>. I don't have one on any of my other bikes and decided not to equip my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/stooge-mk5/\">Stooge MK5</a> with one. A telescoping seat post will wear out even quicker than 3 years on a bike ridden on dusty or muddy trails.</p>",

He faced and reamed the headtube, faced the steerer, installed the race, and pressed in the headset cups. Lastly, he cut the fork steerer with a pipe cutter a few levels above the one I have in my toolbox.

I cut the brake hoses and bled the brakes only to realize that I didn't like how I routed the rear brake hose. Typically, I run it from the right side of the handlebar around the head tube to the left. The rear brake hoses on both my <a href=\"https://www.44bikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fortyfour</a> bikes run that way and enter the side of the top tube. However, the rear brake hose on the Stooge MK5 runs along the underside of the down tube. This lengthens the hose and brings it much closer to the lower headset cup and the fork crown. When riding, it'll oscillate up and down, rattling each time it hits the fork crown. I have to shorten it and run it to the down tube on the right side. The point it'll make contact with the paint of the head tube will be protected with clear frame-protecting tape. The hose to the front brake caliper was also routed differently than usual. Typically, I run it up the backside of the fork leg and let it loop to the brake lever. With the design of the Stooge fork and the position of my left brake lever, the brake hose didn't want to stay on the backside of the fork leg. It slipped to the outside of the fork leg. I wrapped it around the inside of the fork leg, which gave it a natural curve to the brake lever. Transparent skin armor protects the paint wherever the hose contacts the fork.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-7.jpg\" data-size=\"3687x3024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-7-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Seat tube and seat stay junction.\" width=\"720\" height=\"591\"></a>\n<figcaption>Seat tube.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-8.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2627\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-8-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Fork crown and Cane Creek headset.\" width=\"720\" height=\"469\"></a>\n<figcaption>Cane Creek.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-9.jpg\" data-size=\"3593x2845\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-9-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Curved seat tube piece.\" width=\"720\" height=\"570\"></a>\n<figcaption>Curves.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Still on the to-do list is replacing the small steel bolts at the dropouts with golden titanium bolts and the bottom bracket, which will be my own design.
