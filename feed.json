Well, this isn't the place for a great wheel debate, as I believe that every wheel and tire size has its merits. It's all about the rider, his or her skills, intended use, and the terrain the bike will see. I've been on 26\" wheels since 1986, 29ers since <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/250774966\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2006</a>, and fat-bikes since <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/8540578613\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2013</a> (first 26, then 27.5). For a brief period around the turn of the century, I rode <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/21309654772\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hardtails</a> with front suspension, but before and after, I mountain-biked on <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/5542561458\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rigid bikes</a>. My trails generally offer little flow and little speed. They tend to be tight, tricky, and have to be ridden more slowly than fast. While I can maneuver a 29er on such trails just fine, an agile 27.5+ will probably be even more fun to navigate.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1913x2236\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The front wheel.\" width=\"720\" height=\"842\"></a>\n<figcaption>The front wheel.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-02.jpg\" data-size=\"2562x2202\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The rear wheel.\" width=\"720\" height=\"619\"></a>\n<figcaption>The rear wheel.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-03.jpg\" data-size=\"3570x2942\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Rear Onyx Boost hub.\" width=\"720\" height=\"593\"></a>\n<figcaption>Rear Onyx Boost hub.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-04.jpg\" data-size=\"3587x2690\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Rear Onyx Boost hub.\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Rear Onyx Boost hub.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The steeper terrain heavily influenced the choice of brakes. XC brakes would be overwhelmed with the steep descents, so I opted for the same brakes as on my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">Snakedriver</a>; a pair of 4 piston Formula Cura 4 brakes. And to give them yet more power, I matched them up with a 203mm front and a 180mm rear rotor. Most riders would equip their bikes with a dropper. I have one on my fat bike and wouldn't want to miss it on winter rides in the snow. But for every other bike I've owned, I have not used adjustable seat posts, and I'm fine with that pretty much everywhere I ride. So, to keep the Stooge MK5 simple and low maintenance, I'll push a dead gorgeous Thomson Masterpiece into the seat tube.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-05.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Formula Cura 4 brakes.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Formula Cura 4 brakes.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-06.jpg\" data-size=\"2696x2081\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Bolts and small parts.\" width=\"720\" height=\"556\"></a>\n<figcaption>Bolts and small parts.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-07.jpg\" data-size=\"3197x2350\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Bearings and small bits.\" width=\"720\" height=\"529\"></a>\n<figcaption>Bearings and small bits.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-08.jpg\" data-size=\"3948x2104\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-08-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Ritchey Comp Kyote bar.\" width=\"720\" height=\"384\"></a>\n<figcaption>Ritchey Comp Kyote bar.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The wheels were built by local frame builder and lacing wizard Patrik Widmer of <a href=\"https://www.47grad-nord.ch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">47° Nord</a>.

It is mated to a jaw-droppingly sweet Enve aluminum stem. Lastly, a new and untested Prologo Scratch M5 saddle towers on top of the seat post. After years riding various models of Fizik Antares saddles, I switched to Prologo for my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/\">Nordest Albarda</a>. The short-nosed Dimension Nack on that bike feels great. In my humble opinion, an open saddle doesn't belong on a mountain bike nor any bike ridden in the mud. Hence the decision to try out Prologo's Scratch. If the Scratch and my derrière become friends, the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-sl/\">Volagi Viaje</a> and <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">44 Snakedriver</a> will get one too.</p>",

One has to be patient, shop globally, and sometimes just go for available components. While I have always been using 180 mm rotors on the front of my mountain bikes and 160 mm in the back, I'm going a size larger on the <a href=\"#non-existing-post-with-id-46\">Stooge MK5</a>. My favorite Centerlock rotor, TRP's TR-25 was easily sourced in 203 mm diameter. 180 mm though, was nowhere to be found in Europe. I had to order that size from Universal Cycles in the US. They had them at a reduced price, which made the fairly high cost of shipping easier to swallow.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"5\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-06.jpg\" data-size=\"3948x2082\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Prologo Scratch M5 Nack saddle.\" width=\"720\" height=\"380\"></a>\n<figcaption>Prologo saddle.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-07.jpg\" data-size=\"3898x2298\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Rotor Kapic cranks with Boost axle.\" width=\"720\" height=\"424\"></a>\n<figcaption>Rotor Kapic cranks.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-08.jpg\" data-size=\"3608x2399\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-08-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"TRP 203 and 180 mm Centerlock rotors.\" width=\"720\" height=\"479\"></a>\n<figcaption>TRP rotors.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-09.jpg\" data-size=\"3440x2203\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-09-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Ground Control GRID 2Bliss Ready 6Fattie tires.\" width=\"720\" height=\"461\"></a>\n<figcaption>27.5x3.0 tires.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-10.jpg\" data-size=\"3143x2288\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-10-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Rotor 30T Q-Ring.\" width=\"720\" height=\"524\"></a>\n<figcaption>Rotor chainring.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The Light Bicycle AM740 rims I ordered went into production right away. The Onyx Boost hubs had a lead time of 5-6 weeks and arrived as promised. Due to the supply shortages, one would expect prices to be up or at least not to be marked down, but I was able to get two pairs of tires at heavily reduced prices. All I'm missing now is a set of disc brakes. In keeping with standardizing the components across my bikes, the MK5 has to be equipped with the same brakes as my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">44 Snakedriver</a> - Formula Cura 4. They had been stock in most online shops up to a couple of weeks ago. I wasn't expecting that to change, but it did.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://stoogecycles.co.uk/product/mk5-coming-soon-ish/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stooge MK5 frameset</a> has an ETA of August. I don't doubt that the Asian factory will have them made by then, but I wonder if Andy Stevenson will be able to have them shipped to Europe quickly due to the massive port delays out of China.</p>",

Whether you wanted a single-speed, an all-mountain trail bike, or a bike-packing rig – it did it all.</p>\n\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/47/gallery/stooge-mk1.jpg\" data-size=\"1920x1280\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/47/gallery/stooge-mk1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"2014: Stooge MK1 in plum crazy purple.\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a>\n<figcaption>2014 - MK1</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/47/gallery/stooge-mk2.jpg\" data-size=\"1920x1280\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/47/gallery/stooge-mk2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"2015: Stooge MK2 in radberry magenta.\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a>\n<figcaption>2015 - MK2</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/47/gallery/stooge-mk3.jpg\" data-size=\"2000x1333\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/47/gallery/stooge-mk3-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"2017: Stooge MK3 colors.\" width=\"720\" height=\"480\"></a>\n<figcaption>2017 - MK3</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/47/gallery/stooge-mk4.jpg\" data-size=\"2560x1696\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/47/gallery/stooge-mk4-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"2019: Stooge MK4 in moss green.\" width=\"720\" height=\"477\"></a>\n<figcaption>2019 - MK4</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>I would have been stoked to own either an MK3 or an MK4, but they were produced at a time when I didn't actually need such a bike. That has changed in 2021. Last summer I sold my <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157632954649710\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">44 Big Boy</a> fat-bike, which had become my geared trail bike. It was just as a fun bike on dirt as it had been on snow, but after we moved eastwards along the \"Jurasüdfuss\", it became clear that it wasn't the ideal bike for the trails to the north of our new home. Hence the decision to sell it. It found a new owner in the country it was built and is now <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CLQLVG2A6Zeimm3wTEHhlGASJHCHcj3qmV18So0/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">roaming across trails</a> in the great state of Wisconsin. I kept following what Andy made with Stooge and was excited to read that an MK5 was in the pipeline.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://stoogecycles.co.uk/product/mk5-coming-soon-ish/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MK5</a> is a different beast from the MK4. Although Andy has never been a huge fan of boost axles, the market has sort of forced him to adopt the de facto axle standard. The MK5 now has boost spacing front and back. It lost the huge fork offset of the MK4 and now shares the same 57 mm offset bi-plane fork as the previously released Scrambler. Just like the <a href=\"http://stoogecycles.co.uk/2020/05/30/coming-soon-the-stooge-scrambler/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Scrambler</a>, it's equipped with tons of rack and bottle mounting options, so that you can bike-pack this purebred trail-ripper. While you can set it up with 29×3 front/29×2.5-2.6 rear, the MK5 is designed for 27.5x3.0 front and rear, which is exactly the wheel and tire size I wanted to use. Yeah, I know, the trend in mountain biking is currently 29\" and tires have come back to sizes in the 2.4 to 2.6 range. 2.8 and 3.0 still exist while 3.25 is almost extinct. Well, I can care less what the current trend is. If I were, I wouldn't be buying a rigid steel bike, now, would I?</p>\n<p>I'm also stoked that the MK5 will come in <a href=\"http://stoogecycles.co.uk/product/mk5-18-brown-pre-order-deposit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">brown</a>, Pantone <a href=\"https://icolorpalette.com/color/pantone-147-c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">147C</a> to be precise. I've been wanting to own a brown bike forever. If there aren't any unforeseen manufacturing or shipping delays, the ETA should be August 2021. I've got a pretty good idea of how I want to equip the bike, so time has come to place orders to get all the necessary components by the time the frameset arrives. The plan is to strike a good balance between quality and affordability - good parts but within a budget. I have a few bits and pieces already, I've ordered two pairs of 27.5x3.0 tires and need to get hubs and rims next. So, stay tuned for the build progress. Pandemic and all, I'm not setting a timeline on it. It'll be done when it'll be done. I'm lucky to have plenty of other bikes to ride in the meantime. </p>\n<p>All image credits: <a href=\"http://stoogecycles.co.uk/2019/02/28/a-short-history-of-steel-stooge-framesets-and-everything-in-between/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stooge Cycles</a>.</p>",

They smooth out everything. Rather than feeling road vibrations, it feels like sitting aboard a hovercraft. Most riders equate vibrations with speed. Narrow, hard tires transmit all the road chatter to the rider. So, when we feel the road more, we believe that we're going faster, even if the speedometer says otherwise. Separate your body from such vibrations, and you suddenly think that you aren't all that fast, even if the speedometer may say otherwise. I have yet to put enough miles on the bike to figure out how the 650B wheels affect my average speed. And this year isn't representative anyway. I'm unable to train nor rest as much as in the past.</p>\n<p>I was probably one of the first Swiss riders to move from 26\" to 29\" wheels in 2006. I lived still in the US when I bought <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157594265939262\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">my first 29er</a> but had already set things in motion to move back to Switzerland. I was long an advocate of the \"<a href=\"https://www.strava.com/clubs/twentyniner-ch\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bigger is better</a>\" movement. Interestingly, now that the 29\" wheel has become the de facto standard from XC to downhill, I find myself moving away from the trend. I own two 650B road bikes, a 27.5\" fat-bike and I just put a down payment on a 27.5\" mountain bike. There are some interesting months ahead, as I need to shop for components. The frameset should be arriving sometime in August.</p>",

To put it into a turn requires therefore a more forceful steering input. This, I think, can be changed somewhat by reducing the diameter of the wheels. At least that's what happened with the Volagi, which is very agile, to begin with. In fact, with 650B wheels, that bike tends to oversteer. The Albarda should therefore improve in steerability. It was therefore long on my wishlist to equip the bike with a fast set of 650B wheels. Right at the beginning of the year, I set things in motion by ordering a pair of <a href=\"https://www.lightbicycle.com/650b-road-bicycle-rims-32mm-wide-35mm-deep-symmetric-clincher-road-disc-brake-available.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Light Bicycle WR35</a> gravel rims. These are 25mm internal, 32mm external hooked carbon rims with a nice 35mm deep aero profile. At the same time, I ordered a pair of Chris King R45D thru-axle Centerlock hubs from my trusted wheel builder, <a href=\"https://www.47grad-nord.ch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">47° Nord</a>. The hubs arrived at the end of March; the rims arrived in April. Black Sapim CX-Ray spokes and red DT Swiss nipples, 24 per wheel, complete the wheels.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Original setup</span>:\n<ul>\n<li>Nox Citico wheels with Chris King R45D hubs</li>\n<li>René Herse 700C x 38 <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/700c/700cx38-barlow-pass/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Barlow Pass</a> tires (40mm actual measurement)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">New setup</span>:\n<ul>\n<li>47° Nord wheels with Chris King R45D hubs and Light Bicycle WR35 carbon rims</li>\n<li>René Herse 650B x 48 <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/650b/650bx48-switchback-hill/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Switchback Hill</a> tires</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Alternative setup</span>:\n<ul>\n<li>Nox Citico 700C wheels with Chris King R45D hubs</li>\n<li>René Herse 700C x 44 <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/700c/700cx44-snoqualmie-pass/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snoqualmie Pass</a> tires</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All tubeless of course.

I climbed to the Jobert farm in the hope to find snowmobile tracks, but the farm was unoccupied and tracks were nowhere to be found. Pushing my bike, I stomped through deep snow for about four kilometers. The road south to the Métairie de Gléresse had not been groomed either, so my only option was to drop to the Anabaptist Bridge. Just before getting there, I noticed that a snowmobile had traveled to the Métairie Pierrefeu, so I went that way. The snowmobile track continued west, but I decided to turn around. The only rideable path was the <a href=\"https://www.loipen.ch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cross-country ski track</a> to the Place Centrale. I generally avoid those because Swiss cross-country skiers don't have the winter spirit of the Fins or the Norges and don't like to share. They pay for the use of those cross-country ski tracks, so it's understandable to a point. I hopped onto the winter hiking trail to get down into the village. The trail must have been groomed in the morning but was already in poor shape due to hiker use. In December and January, most people on foot wear snowshoes. Strangely, at the end of March, almost no one does. When I was zipping by the <a href=\"https://presdorvin-ski.ch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ski resort</a>, I saw that the lifts were operating and people were on the slopes. So, instead of riding to my car, I climbed to the top of the ski lift for a fun descent on the slope. I think I did that only one other time this winter.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/43/gallery/march-fat-bike-4.jpg\" data-size=\"3033x1706\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/43/gallery/march-fat-bike-4-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Walls, roots and dirt.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Roots and dirt.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/43/gallery/march-fat-bike-5.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/43/gallery/march-fat-bike-5-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Rough trails are easier on snow.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Easier on snow.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/43/gallery/march-fat-bike-6.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/43/gallery/march-fat-bike-6-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Perfect climbs thanks to snowmobile usage.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Perfect climb.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/43/gallery/march-fat-bike-7.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/43/gallery/march-fat-bike-7-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"A lonely day in the snow.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Lonely day.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/43/gallery/march-fat-bike-8.jpg\" data-size=\"3414x1920\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/43/gallery/march-fat-bike-8-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Some fun single-track.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Fun single-track.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/43/gallery/march-fat-bike-9.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/43/gallery/march-fat-bike-9-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Returning across the Montagne de Romont.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Montagne de Romont.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Due to the amount of snow encountered on Saturday, I decided to try my luck at lower elevations on Sunday. Plagne, a small hilltop village just a 16-minute drive from home was my starting point. Whereas parking had been absolute chaos on weekends only a month ago, I arrived at a nearly empty parking lot. I started my ride by heading west to the \"Sur Les Roches\" area high above Rondchâtel. I looped back to Plagne to drop into the valley north of it. At the end of the valley there are two ways out; southeast to the Stierenberg, or north. This winter I discovered that the northern-facing climb is often used by snowmobiles, and Sunday was no different. I found some wonderful hardpack to climb to the Tiefmatt Restaurant, where a half dozen snowmobiles were parked outside. I continued to the Obergrenchenberg on the road on a mix of clean pavement, ice and snow. Unlike Prés d'Orvin the day before, the two <a href=\"https://www.grenchenberge.ch/grenchenberge/skilifte-grenchenberg/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">ski lifts of the Grenchenberg</a> were not in operation. I jumped onto a single trail to the Stierenberg and a winter hiking trail to the Montagne de Romont. The last few miles back to the car had to be ridden on sometimes wet, sometimes frozen gravel. The parking lot was just as empty as in the morning, which is probably a sign that most Swiss have grown tired of winter and desperately wait for spring to arrive. Well, I don't; my fat-bike season can never be long enough.</p>",

In the winter I no longer wanted something that lets a lot of air through. A warmer helmet that covers the head more protects one’s head better from wind and snow. My first fat-bike helmet was a Bern <a href=\"https://products.mtbr.com/product/mtb-apparel-and-protection/helmet/bern/brentwood.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Brentwood</a>, which I had bought years earlier as a helmet for my daily bike commute. It has served me well and is still being used on many of my fat-bike rides. For very cold or snowy days, I bought a Smith <a href=\"https://www.smithoptics.com/en_US/helmets-snow/VANTAGE-HELMET.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Vantage</a>, a goggle-friendly ski helmet with ear pads and adjustable vents. So, when I'm out during a heavy snowstorm, I can completely close the front and back vents separately. On super cold days, it’s been amazing to head out with the Vantage on my head and a matching pair of Smith Optics goggles covering my eyes.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/42/gallery/cycling-helmets-1.jpg\" data-size=\"3691x2080\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/42/gallery/cycling-helmets-1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"My bike helmets by Bern and Smith.\" width=\"720\" height=\"406\"></a>\n<figcaption>My bike helmets.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/42/gallery/cycling-helmets-2.jpg\" data-size=\"3553x2002\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/42/gallery/cycling-helmets-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"My bike helmets by Bern and Smith.\" width=\"720\" height=\"406\"></a>\n<figcaption>Smith Forefront 2.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/42/gallery/cycling-helmets-3.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/42/gallery/cycling-helmets-3-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"My bike helmets by Bern and Smith.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Two fat-bike, one MTB helmet.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The Giro Aeon helmet I have been wearing for mountain biking has seen many years of use and abuse. It was time to replace it. This time, I’ve opted for a mountain-bike-specific helmet and picked a <a href=\"https://www.smithoptics.com/en_US/helmets-bike/FOREFRONT2-HELMET.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Smith Forefront 2</a>. It falls into the most popular type of mountain bike helmets; open-face or half-shell helmets that sit a bit deeper on one's head, extending down the nape of the neck, with extra coverage around the temples. The Forefront 2 was released in 2018, so it's not a brand-new model. One of the big selling points for me are the channels on the front and rear of the helmet for eyewear storage. When I climb up a mountain, I usually take off my glasses and push them into the vents of my helmet. That works well on the front of the Giro Aeon as well as the Synthe, although the Synthe wears off the rubber padding of the earpieces over the years. The <a href=\"https://koroyd.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Koroyd</a> construction of the Forefront 2 is said to reduce airflow, so ventilation isn’t as good as it could be. That Koroyd technology on the other hand has one benefit, bugs don’t end up crawling through one’s hair when they get trapped in a vent during a fast-speed descent through the forest. With my generally short hair, it may also better protect my head from the sun. It remains to be seen if the Forefront 2 will be too warm of a lid for summer rides. If there's one thing about summer, it's feeling hot. If so, there’s still an Aeon and a Synthe I can use. It may also turn out that the Forefront 2 will be my helmet of choice for warmer winter days.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; border-style: solid;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #ecf0f1;\">\n<th style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>Helmet</strong></th>\n<th style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>Color</strong></th>\n<th style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"><strong>Year purchased</strong></th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Bern Brentwood</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">black/gray/green</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">2012</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Giro Aeon</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">black/red/white</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Giro Aeon</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">blue</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">2016</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Giro Synthe</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">black/orange</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">2016</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Smith Vantage</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">matte charcoal</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">2018</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">Smith Forefront 2</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">matte gravy</td>\n<td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\">2021</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

And since I have not been spending much during the seemingly never-ending pandemic, I shelled out some extra cash to exchange the aluminum <a href=\"https://rotorbike.com/catalog/default/rotor/road/cranks/aldhu.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Rotor Aldhu</a> cranks with recently released <a href=\"https://rotorbike.com/catalog/default/rotor/road/cranks/aldhu-carbon.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aldhu Carbon</a> cranks. The carbon version of the cranks just fits better into the overall look of the bike. They are lighter, too but I have reached an age where a few extra grams more or less do not matter. This beauty of a bike is now almost too flipping nice to be ridden. No seriously, with five bikes at my disposal and life circumstances currently throwing a wrench into my freedom to ride, I am not yet sure where the bike will fit in. But it is there on the rack, ready to hit the road when I can or want to. It does not need to be this year. It is ready when I have a permit to freely ride up and down the Swiss Jura again.</p>",

While it stayed below zero, the Vantage helmet, the goggles, and thick gloves stayed at home this time.  I did the same loop as the day before with an extension to Plagne right at the start of the ride. And what an extension it was. Near the small hilltop village of Romont, I turned into a trail that was completely frozen for almost a mile. The rains and snowmelt created a large water reservoir at the end of the trail, and the trail had turned into a downright creek. When the temperatures dropped far below zero, that creek froze over entirely. I rode across it with my studded tires with a huge grin on my face.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"5\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/40/gallery/icy-weekend-6.jpg\" data-size=\"2498x1405\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/40/gallery/icy-weekend-6-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Downhill past the White Wall.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>White Wall.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/40/gallery/icy-weekend-7.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/40/gallery/icy-weekend-7-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Late afternoon downhill.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Late afternoon.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/40/gallery/icy-weekend-8.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/40/gallery/icy-weekend-8-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"A completely frozen over trail.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Frozen trail.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/40/gallery/icy-weekend-9.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/40/gallery/icy-weekend-9-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"So good to have studded tires.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Studded tires.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/40/gallery/icy-weekend-0.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/40/gallery/icy-weekend-0-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"A temporary lake.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Temporary lake.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>By pure chance, I discovered a trail from the Stierenberg to the Grenchenberg that had been used by snowmobiles, and on Sunday observed multiple snowmobilers racing across the hills, which by the way is illegal in this country. I guess no one complains and no one checks because you can't hide snowmobile tracks crisscrossing the open hillsides in every direction. My feelings about that are somewhat mixed. As a fat-biker in a country where you just have to ride whatever is rideable in the winter, snowmobile tracks are super useful to travel through the winter world. On the other hand, these things burn fuel and with their speed and noise are problematic for the wildlife that needs to make it through the winter. There are ways to use them responsibly, but what I watched Sunday was anything but responsible.</p>",

Some of the snowshoe trails are marked, and many are not. Once the sun drops low, it's time to return home. A beautiful, but at times risky downhill trail quickly destroys the 2'000 feet and spits me out into a fun labyrinth of trees. In the summer, it's easy to follow a footpath through those woods. In the winter, the most fun is not to get lost in the maze of trees, especially in the late afternoon when daylight is darkening. As long as the weather permits, I'll be fat-biking up there. It's a lot more convenient to start at the house without having to drive someplace.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/39/gallery/territory-change-5.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/39/gallery/territory-change-5-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Once the sun is low it's time to head home.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>A low sun.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/39/gallery/territory-change-6.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/39/gallery/territory-change-6-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Hitting the downhill to get home.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Homebound.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/39/gallery/territory-change-7.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/39/gallery/territory-change-7-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Last snowshoe trail before heading home.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Last snowshoe trail.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/39/gallery/territory-change-8.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/39/gallery/territory-change-8-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Perfect fat-bike trails.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Perfect trails.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>",
