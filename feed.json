In the years since we’ve only used the domain name for our email addresses but kept it with G Suite. At work, for instance, I access my email using Google mail in the web browser. The free G Suite is <a href=\"https://9to5google.com/2022/01/19/g-suite-legacy-free-edition/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">coming to an end</a> and anyone using it will have to move to a paid Workspace subscription. For the two of us that would be $12.00 per month or $144.00 a year. That in of itself is not much and Workspace offers a lot, but when one adds it to all the other paid subscriptions, it adds up to a considerable amount of cash. Since we’re already paying for Office 365 and iCloud, we’ve decided to say goodbye to Google. Since I still need Google for a few small things, I created a new Gmail account. I moved a Google sheet with a log of my Strava rides to that account and recreated my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/strava-dashboard-in-data-studio/\">Data Studio dashboard</a> under that new account. I also gave my MacBook a bit of work to do by moving all my archived emails out of Google and into iCloud. We’ll be moving our email domain to iCloud+. I cleaned up Google Drive and moved what I wanted to keep to OneDrive. The Office 365 subscription comes with 1 TB of storage after all. I’m ready to flip the switch. Now my wife will have to sort through her mail and move things to iCloud, and we can kill our G Suite account.</p>\n<p>With me busy on the computer and my wife sleeping in, it got late for a fat-bike ride. I contemplated loading the bike in the car and driving somewhere, but any minute spent in the car is a minute wasted that could be spent on the bike. So, although all the snow around the house has melted, I knew that I didn’t have to ride far to find some. To my biggest surprise, the gravel roads through our forests at a bit more elevation are completely white. To gain altitude quickly, I took a steep trail that is tough to ride without snow. I did fine at first, but further up the trail was a little more exposed to the sun, which softened the snow enough to make it nearly unclimbable. I didn’t mind the occasional hike. I gained elevation and didn’t have to take my studded tires onto pavement. I did a nice loop from the Romontberg to Plagne and back, riding lots of snowshoe trails and snowmobile tracks. Back at the Romontberg, I decided to extend the loop by heading to the Stierenberg. There’s nice singletrack to get there and sure enough, it was an absolute blast to ride it. I don’t care too much for the trails down the Stierenberg, so I took another way back to the Romontberg. Unfortunately, that trail wasn’t rideable. It’s a short stretch when you can ride it. Stomping through the snow with nightfall approaching, it seemed endless. I would have loved to take another photo or two on the downhill, but with the sun gone and the light fading, I only cared to make it home as quickly as possible.</p>",

The hubs need new bearings. Chainring, chain, and cog need to be replaced as well. Once winter is over, some work will be done to my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">44 Snakedriver</a>. Here too, the hub bearings will be replaced, a new drivetrain will be mounted, and later in the year, I'll swap saddle and dropper.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/58/january-this-that-3.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/58/responsive/january-this-that-3-xs.jpg 300w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/58/responsive/january-this-that-3-sm.jpg 480w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/58/responsive/january-this-that-3-md.jpg 768w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/58/responsive/january-this-that-3-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/58/responsive/january-this-that-3-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/58/responsive/january-this-that-3-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"Mac Book Pro\" width=\"2127\" height=\"2133\">\n<figcaption >My \"new\" 2016 15\" MacBook Pro.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p>In other news, after a whopping 3 years after my MacBook Pro died, I finally have a new one. Well, not new New. My wife got a new MacBook Pro, and she handed me her 2016 15\" MacBook Pro with a 2.9 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 processor. I wiped the drive and started with a fresh 12.1 Monterey macOS. Most apps I need have been installed. One huge piece of work was merging the Photos library from my old Mac with the photos I've taken in the past 3 years. I never transferred any of the new pictures to a computer.

Since I've been riding less, I never found the need to purchase new clothes. For 2022, I decided to get a handful of new garments. I often wear a sleeveless vest, whether in the winter over a jacket or on cooler days over a short or long-sleeve jersey. <a href=\"https://www.primaleurope.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Primal Wear</a> makes two nice camo vests, one green the other black/white. I bought the green one first, and once I saw fit and quality, I also got a black/white one. In addition, I ordered a camo jersey from Primal, a green <a href=\"https://dhbsport.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">DHB</a> winter jacket, and two long sleeve jerseys from <a href=\"https://www.wiggle.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Wiggle</a>. That should be plenty for 2022.</p>",

The equipment chosen, the tires selected, the pressure they're inflated to, and most notably missing in a simple two-dimensional representation of a bike are handlebar width and shape. Where one's hands are positioned, in which angle they rest on the bar, how low or how high they grab the bar, all that dramatically influences how a bike feels.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse:

If all else were equal, it would mean it has the most upright position of the three. With the by far longest head tube, the tall stack isn't surprising. One could think that the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">Snakedriver</a> has the most stretched out and aggressive position based on the huge reach figure, but equipped with a <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/45-is-the-new-20/\">Jones H-bar</a> that's not the case. The 9 mm reach difference between MK5 and <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-marauder/\">Marauder</a> was the reason I opted for a 50 mm stem for the MK5 versus a 40 mm stem on the Marauder. It's interesting to point out that the MK5 has a shorter reach yet has a slightly longer top tube than the Marauder.</p>\n<p>One measurement I use, and one which you won't find in any manufacturer's geometry chart, is the distance from the saddle nose to the center of my palm when holding the handlebar. On the MK5 I have a short-nosed <a href=\"https://prologo.it/en/collections/marathon-xc/products/scratch-m5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Prologo Scratch M5 Nack</a> saddle, so in that case, I compare not the distance from the nose but from the back of the saddle (saddle to grip in the table above). There are three points your body contacts the bike after all. Your feet stand on the pedals, your butt sits on the saddle, and your hands grab the handlebar. As already hinted before, although the Snakedriver has the longest reach, it has the shortest saddle-to-grip distance. The Marauder, the only bike with a setback seat post, is the longest. The Stooge is slightly longer than the Snakedriver, which should be good. Both bikes are geared, and I'm pedaling more in the saddle when I have 12 cogs I can shift into. The stretched position on the Marauder is ideal because it's mostly ridden out of the saddle being a single-speed.</p>\n<p>Let's move on to the head tube angles, where the Marauder has an almost old-schoolishly steep 70°. It doesn't hinder me, though, to have fun on that bike. The Snakedriver with 68° would nowadays also be considered steep. Angles have slackened quite a bit these past couple of years. The MK5 sports the slackest head tube angle with 66°. If I discover that this suits me well, the next fat-bike in a couple of years may well be designed like that as well.</p>\n<p>Let's jump a few rows down to the fork figures. Here, the MK5 stands out with the most rake (or fork offset) and the longest trail. It'll be interesting to discover the steering characteristics of the bike. The common belief has always been that more trail makes a bike more stable. And on the other end, less trail, less stability, and as a result, more agility. Jan Heine <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/trail-does-not-make-a-bike-stable/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">recently experimented</a> with two bikes and noticed that the number to look at isn't trail, but wheel flop. He called wheel flop \"power steering.\" The more you have on a bike, the easier it is to turn it. The MK5 happens to have the most wheel flop. Such \"power steering\" is obviously good on technical terrain downhill. Will it be too much \"power steering\" to keep the bike in a straight line while climbing?</p>\n<p>Let's jump back up a few rows and look at the bottom bracket. Here the Marauder has the most ground clearance. The Snakedriver, which has the largest wheels, has the bottom bracket as low as the MK5. I had it designed that way. When I approached Kris to build my second fat bike, I asked him for a snow-specific geometry. It wasn't meant to be a general-purpose fat bike, and that's why we put the bottom bracket low, as you want to be as low as possible in soft snow. The BB of the MK5 is surprisingly low, too. This probably has to do with the fact, that Andy designed the bike for both 27.5\" and 29\" wheels. Since I'm using the smaller wheels the BB drops closer to the ground.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I'm ending this analysis with a look at lengths. The Marauder is the shortest bike overall, front-center, as well as in the back. The Snakedriver is unsurprisingly the longest of the three. Again, the thinking was length provides stability, and directional stability is what you want in snow or sand. The MK5 is on the long side as well.</p>",

Unfortunately, I only managed to head out for a ride on Monday, the last day of my extended weekend. On Sunday, I had my booster shot midday, which meant not enough time before the appointment, and then it was too late to head to Prés d'Orvin, which is a popular weekend destination for anyone wanting to go into the snow. On a side note, I was pretty impressed with how well organized the vaccination center was and how quickly I was in and out of there with a booster shot into my left shoulder and a new certificate in my right hand. Back to the topic; on weekends I prefer to be in Prés d'Orvin before 8AM and be done with my ride when the masses arrive. This year, I'm not able to leave this early, so I'm less inclined to drive up there. But, on a weekday like this Monday, the place isn't busy. Traffic is light, and parking is plentiful. The ski lifts were operating, but the slope wasn't busy. I decided to climb it for my first descent of the winter. The snow was great, but poor visibility due to heavy fog made descending challenging.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-4.jpg\" data-size=\"3838x1725\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-4-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Alone at the Chasseral antenna.\" width=\"720\" height=\"324\"></a>\n<figcaption>Chasseral antenna.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-5.jpg\" data-size=\"3831x1642\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-5-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The sunny view from the top of the Chasseral.\" width=\"720\" height=\"309\"></a>\n<figcaption>Top of the Chasseral.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-6.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-6-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The action starts right there.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Crest trail.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Once at the bottom, I turned west to climb towards the Place Centrale. The winter hiking trails were perfectly groomed all the way to the cross-country skiing center. From there, I had to hop on the ice-covered road for about a kilometer, until the winter hiking trail continued off to the left. The official winter hiking path, when groomed, makes a turn eastwards to bring people to the Place Centrale. To my surprise, that upper leg of the trail was missing. Fortunately for me, hordes of snowshoers had taken the straight way up the mountain on the weekend, leaving behind a perfectly rideable trail from bottom to top. I finally got out of the fog while getting up that climb. I dropped down on the northern side, rode the cross-country ski track for a few hundred meters, then took the straight way to the Métairie du Milieu de Bienne, where I hopped back on the cross-country ski track. It dropped me right off at the backside of the Chasseral. The climb to the antenna that followed wasn't rideable. It rarely is.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-7.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-7-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Leaving the Chasseral behind.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Trail fun.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-8.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-8-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"A gorgeous day to be up there.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Gorgeous day.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-9.jpg\" data-size=\"3840x2160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/56/gallery/weekday-fatbike-ride-9-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The trail couldn't have been better.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Ideal conditions.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The best followed at that point; the crest trail eastwards back to the Place Centrale. It was rideable all the way, even some of the challenging drops that are formed by snow accumulation. The dropper seat post comes in handy along this trail. Each time the trail drops, I lower the dropper. Each time the trail is flat or has an incline, I move the saddle back to the top. After 3 years of usage, the thing needs to be serviced, though. Most droppers aren't user-serviceable and need to be sent in for service. I hate that. This is the main reason I've never and will never own a full-suspension bike or even a hardtail. I simply don't want parts on a bike that I can't easily service myself. Because a dropper post offers some real benefits, particularly for a fat-bike ridden in snow, I have one on my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">Snakedriver</a>. I don't have one on any of my other bikes and decided not to equip my <a href=\"#non-existing-post-with-id-46\">Stooge MK5</a> with one. A telescoping seat post will wear out even quicker than 3 years on a bike ridden on dusty or muddy trails.</p>",

He faced and reamed the headtube, faced the steerer, installed the race, and pressed in the headset cups.

I cut the brake hoses and bled the brakes only to realize that I didn't like how I routed the rear brake hose. Typically, I run it from the right side of the handlebar around the head tube to the left. The rear brake hoses on both my <a href=\"https://www.44bikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Fortyfour</a> bikes run that way and enter the side of the top tube. However, the rear brake hose on the Stooge MK5 runs along the underside of the down tube. This lengthens the hose and brings it much closer to the lower headset cup and the fork crown. When riding, it'll oscillate up and down, rattling each time it hits the fork crown. I have to shorten it and run it to the down tube on the right side. The point it'll make contact with the paint of the head tube will be protected with clear frame-protecting tape. The hose to the front brake caliper was also routed differently than usual. Typically, I run it up the backside of the fork leg and let it loop to the brake lever. With the design of the Stooge fork and the position of my left brake lever, the brake hose didn't want to stay on the backside of the fork leg. It slipped to the outside of the fork leg. I wrapped it around the inside of the fork leg, which gave it a natural curve to the brake lever. Transparent skin armor protects the paint wherever the hose contacts the fork.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-7.jpg\" data-size=\"3687x3024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-7-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Seat tube and seat stay junction.\" width=\"720\" height=\"591\"></a>\n<figcaption>Seat tube.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-8.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2627\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-8-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Fork crown and Cane Creek headset.\" width=\"720\" height=\"469\"></a>\n<figcaption>Cane Creek.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-9.jpg\" data-size=\"3593x2845\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/55/gallery/stooge-mk5-9-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Curved seat tube piece.\" width=\"720\" height=\"570\"></a>\n<figcaption>Curves.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Still on the to-do list is replacing the small steel bolts at the dropouts with golden titanium bolts and the bottom bracket, which will be my own design.

I’ve had two <a href=\"https://products.roadbikereview.com/product/clothing/helmets/giro/exodus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Exodus</a>, two <a href=\"https://products.roadbikereview.com/product/clothing/helmets/giro/atmos.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Atmos</a>, three <a href=\"https://products.roadbikereview.com/product/clothing/helmets/giro/aeon.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aeon</a>, and one <a href=\"https://products.roadbikereview.com/product/clothing/helmets/giro/synthe-515639.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Synthe</a> helmet. They fit my head well, and I liked them all. There’s nothing negative I could say about them. It would have been an obvious choice to look at an <a href=\"https://www.giro.com/p/aether-mips-road-bike-helmet/100000000300000099.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Aether</a> or <a href=\"https://www.giro.com/p/helios-spherical-road-bike-helmet/100000000300000129.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Helios</a> helmet. But I found a good deal on a discontinued <a href=\"https://www.lazersport.com/global/helmets/on-road/genesis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Lazer Genesis</a> helmet in orange, which happens to be my color of choice for the darker fall and winter period of the year.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/52/gallery/lazer-genesis-8.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/52/gallery/lazer-genesis-8-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Lazer Genesis in Orange.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Lazer Genesis in Orange.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/52/gallery/lazer-genesis-7.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/52/gallery/lazer-genesis-7-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Lazer Genesis in Chrome.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Lazer Genesis in Chrome.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/52/gallery/lazer-genesis-6.jpg\" data-size=\"3515x2028\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/52/gallery/lazer-genesis-6-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Lazer Genesis in Orange.\" width=\"720\" height=\"415\"></a>\n<figcaption>Lazer Genesis in Orange.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/52/gallery/lazer-genesis-5.jpg\" data-size=\"3637x2127\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/52/gallery/lazer-genesis-5-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Lazer Genesis in Chrome and Orange.\" width=\"720\" height=\"421\"></a>\n<figcaption>Lazer Genesis in Chrome and Orange.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>After a few rides with the Genesis, I decided to get a second one in a more neutral color. I found another discontinued color; the 2021 LTD Chrome Black Edition. Otherwise, I would have waited until spring and gone with the 2022 <a href=\"https://www.lazersport.com/global/helmets/on-road/genesis-blue-haze-limited-edition\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Blue Haze Limited Edition</a>. Chrome/black is not as neutral as matte black or matte titanium. It stands out within the wide range of road cycling helmets in that chrome finish. Something different for sure. So, hopefully, I’m set for the next five or more years with these two helmets.</p>",

Everything felt sluggish about them. Out of the saddle, it felt like fighting the wheels. On rough road surfaces, the narrower tires with 0.5 bar more pressure than what I run the 650Bs, felt considerably harder. Downhills and flat stretches of road were fine. It took a few more rides to adjust to the larger wheels, and climbing no longer feels as strange. The WTB Nano tires stayed airtight. They roll surprisingly well on pavement and are an absolute blast on gravel. Now that I have them on the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/\">Nordest Albarda</a>, I’ve been including more gravel into my rides. Autumn, in my opinion, is far nicer for gravel riding as gravel roads don’t have that looseness and dust that they suffer from during the summer months. The extra moisture in the air makes gravel roads much faster, and the lower temperatures probably too.</p>\n<p>A quick update on the <a href=\"#non-existing-post-with-id-46\">Stooge MK5</a> project: While I had no difficulties finding all the components needed for the bike, Andy couldn’t get the framesets on the first boat leaving Asia. Getting goods on cargo ships these days isn’t easy and has become increasingly expensive. I work for a machine tool company that gets its machines from Japan. To ship one of our \"<a href=\"https://english.mazak.jp/machines/integrex-i-250h-st/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bread and butter</a>\" machines to Europe can easily cost up to 150’000.00 Euros or more. We used to pay about 30’000 Euros pre-pandemic. Whether it’s bike frames, machines, or diapers, moving goods across the globe has become extremely expensive. It may ultimately be a good thing as we have to rethink the working of our economies in the face of climate change. But in the short term, it poses all sorts of problems. But back to the MK5. The framesets arrived at <a href=\"http://stoogecycles.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stooge HQ</a> in the UK and should be mailed to all those who pre-ordered very soon.</p>",

This 4500-lumen front light mounts smack in the front center of my stem, thanks to a Garmin-style <a href=\"https://magicshine.com/products/magicshine%C2%AE-mj-6272-out-front-bike-mount\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">MJ-6272</a> front mount.

It is going to shield the battery from the elements and the cold. When I returned from my last two rides, dusk started to set in while coming down the mountain. I still saw plenty but will be using the light from now on to be seen by the occasional driver that may come up the road. On my narrow roads in the woods, an un-illuminated cyclist can easily be missed after all. </p>",

It's all about the rider, his or her skills, intended use, and the terrain the bike will see. I've been on 26\" wheels since 1986, 29ers since <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/250774966\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2006</a>, and fat-bikes since <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/8540578613\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2013</a> (first 26, then 27.5). For a brief period around the turn of the century, I rode <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/21309654772\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hardtails</a> with front suspension, but before and after, I mountain-biked on <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/5542561458\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">rigid bikes</a>. My trails generally offer little flow and little speed. They tend to be tight, tricky, and have to be ridden more slowly than fast. While I can maneuver a 29er on such trails just fine, an agile 27.5+ will probably be even more fun to navigate.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-01.jpg\" data-size=\"1913x2236\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-01-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The front wheel.\" width=\"720\" height=\"842\"></a>\n<figcaption>The front wheel.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-02.jpg\" data-size=\"2562x2202\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-02-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"The rear wheel.\" width=\"720\" height=\"619\"></a>\n<figcaption>The rear wheel.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-03.jpg\" data-size=\"3570x2942\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-03-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Rear Onyx Boost hub.\" width=\"720\" height=\"593\"></a>\n<figcaption>Rear Onyx Boost hub.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-04.jpg\" data-size=\"3587x2690\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-04-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Rear Onyx Boost hub.\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>Rear Onyx Boost hub.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The steeper terrain heavily influenced the choice of brakes. XC brakes would be overwhelmed with the steep descents, so I opted for the same brakes as on my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">Snakedriver</a>; a pair of 4 piston Formula Cura 4 brakes. And to give them yet more power, I matched them up with a 203mm front and a 180mm rear rotor. Most riders would equip their bikes with a dropper. I have one on my fat bike and wouldn't want to miss it on winter rides in the snow. But for every other bike I've owned, I have not used adjustable seat posts, and I'm fine with that pretty much everywhere I ride. So, to keep the Stooge MK5 simple and low maintenance, I'll push a dead gorgeous Thomson Masterpiece into the seat tube.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-05.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-05-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Formula Cura 4 brakes.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Formula Cura 4 brakes.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-06.jpg\" data-size=\"2696x2081\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Bolts and small parts.\" width=\"720\" height=\"556\"></a>\n<figcaption>Bolts and small parts.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-07.jpg\" data-size=\"3197x2350\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Bearings and small bits.\" width=\"720\" height=\"529\"></a>\n<figcaption>Bearings and small bits.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-08.jpg\" data-size=\"3948x2104\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/49/gallery/pandemic-part2-08-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Ritchey Comp Kyote bar.\" width=\"720\" height=\"384\"></a>\n<figcaption>Ritchey Comp Kyote bar.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The wheels were built by local frame builder and lacing wizard Patrik Widmer of <a href=\"https://www.47grad-nord.ch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">47° Nord</a>.

It is mated to a jaw-droppingly sweet Enve aluminum stem. Lastly, a new and untested Prologo Scratch M5 saddle towers on top of the seat post. After years riding various models of Fizik Antares saddles, I switched to Prologo for my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/\">Nordest Albarda</a>. The short-nosed Dimension Nack on that bike feels great. In my humble opinion, an open saddle doesn't belong on a mountain bike nor any bike ridden in the mud. Hence the decision to try out Prologo's Scratch. If the Scratch and my derrière become friends, the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-sl/\">Volagi Viaje</a> and <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">44 Snakedriver</a> will get one too.</p>",

One has to be patient, shop globally, and sometimes just go for available components. While I have always been using 180 mm rotors on the front of my mountain bikes and 160 mm in the back, I'm going a size larger on the <a href=\"#non-existing-post-with-id-46\">Stooge MK5</a>. My favorite Centerlock rotor, TRP's TR-25 was easily sourced in 203 mm diameter. 180 mm though, was nowhere to be found in Europe. I had to order that size from Universal Cycles in the US. They had them at a reduced price, which made the fairly high cost of shipping easier to swallow.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"5\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-06.jpg\" data-size=\"3948x2082\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-06-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Prologo Scratch M5 Nack saddle.\" width=\"720\" height=\"380\"></a>\n<figcaption>Prologo saddle.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-07.jpg\" data-size=\"3898x2298\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-07-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Rotor Kapic cranks with Boost axle.\" width=\"720\" height=\"424\"></a>\n<figcaption>Rotor Kapic cranks.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-08.jpg\" data-size=\"3608x2399\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-08-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"TRP 203 and 180 mm Centerlock rotors.\" width=\"720\" height=\"479\"></a>\n<figcaption>TRP rotors.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-09.jpg\" data-size=\"3440x2203\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-09-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Specialized Ground Control GRID 2Bliss Ready 6Fattie tires.\" width=\"720\" height=\"461\"></a>\n<figcaption>27.5x3.0 tires.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-10.jpg\" data-size=\"3143x2288\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/48//gallery/bike-build-pandemic-10-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"Rotor 30T Q-Ring.\" width=\"720\" height=\"524\"></a>\n<figcaption>Rotor chainring.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The Light Bicycle AM740 rims I ordered went into production right away. The Onyx Boost hubs had a lead time of 5-6 weeks and arrived as promised. Due to the supply shortages, one would expect prices to be up or at least not to be marked down, but I was able to get two pairs of tires at heavily reduced prices. All I'm missing now is a set of disc brakes. In keeping with standardizing the components across my bikes, the MK5 has to be equipped with the same brakes as my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">44 Snakedriver</a> - Formula Cura 4. They had been stock in most online shops up to a couple of weeks ago. I wasn't expecting that to change, but it did.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://stoogecycles.co.uk/product/mk5-coming-soon-ish/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Stooge MK5 frameset</a> has an ETA of August. I don't doubt that the Asian factory will have them made by then, but I wonder if Andy Stevenson will be able to have them shipped to Europe quickly due to the massive port delays out of China.</p>",
