The plan was to buy components little by little to have it completed by year's end. Having slowly but constantly moved to larger and larger tires (check <a href=\"https://collideous.github.io/40-is-the-new-28/\">40 Is The New 28</a>), I wanted to go one step wider yet. So the SL received 650Bx47 WTB Horizon tires. Clearance inside the rear triangle is plenty, which is amazing for a bike that was originally <a href=\"https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/874048428/the-viaje-bicycle-engineered-for-adventure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">designed in 2012</a>. Clearance inside the fork however is a little tight. I have a pair of Compass 650Bx42 Babyshoe Pass which will widen that clearance, though so far I stayed with the Horizons.<br><br>Components were chosen by what I know and trust as well as to standardize them a little. My Ritte Snob Disc underwent an update in 2020 and the Nordest Albarda was built with a very similar set of parts. Using the same brake and drivetrain parts across three bikes just makes upkeep and maintenance easier. <br><br>Somehow Volagi managed to screw up the rear caliper mount on two of three frames. On my black CX the SRAM Force CX1 caliper sat too low causing the rotor to rub. While the creme/black SL is overall the cleanest welded one of the three, the caliper mount was off as well. I had to add 1mm spacers below the caliper to give the rotor enough clearance. I found some nicely machined titanium washers with just the right diameter and thickness to make the correction, though. An easy, clean fix.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; border-color: #7e8c8d; border-style: solid; width: 716px;\">\n<thead>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #ced4d9;\">\n<th style=\"width: 716px;\" colspan=\"3\">Info</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">First Ride</td>\n<td style=\"width: 509px;\" colspan=\"2\">March 3, 2019</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">Bike Weight</td>\n<td style=\"width: 509px;\" colspan=\"2\">9.3 kg</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">Mileage</td>\n<td style=\"width: 509px;\" colspan=\"2\">5'419 km</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #ced4d9;\">\n<th style=\"width: 716px;\" colspan=\"3\">Components</th>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background-color: #ecf0f1;\">\n<th style=\"width: 207px;\">Type</th>\n<th style=\"width: 200px;\">Brand</th>\n<th style=\"width: 309px;\">Model</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">Frame</td>\n<td style=\"width: 200px;\">Volagi</td>\n<td style=\"width: 309px;\">Viaje SL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">Fork</td>\n<td style=\"width: 200px;\">Volagi</td>\n<td style=\"width: 309px;\">Viaje </td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">Handlebar</td>\n<td style=\"width: 200px;\">Thomson</td>\n<td style=\"width: 309px;\">KFC-One, 44cm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">Brakes</td>\n<td style=\"width: 200px;\">Hope</td>\n<td style=\"width: 309px;\">RX4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">Seatpost</td>\n<td style=\"width: 200px;\">Zipp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 309px;\">SL Speed</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">Stem</td>\n<td style=\"width: 200px;\">Zipp</td>\n<td style=\"width: 309px;\">Service Course SL</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">Wheels</td>\n<td style=\"width: 200px;\">Black Cat</td>\n<td style=\"width: 309px;\">I9 Hubs, Kinlin TL-23 Rims</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">Pedals</td>\n<td style=\"width: 200px;\">Crank Brothers</td>\n<td style=\"width: 309px;\">Eggbeater 3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">Tires</td>\n<td style=\"width: 200px;\">WTB</td>\n<td style=\"width: 309px;\">Horizon, 650Bx47</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">Saddle</td>\n<td style=\"width: 200px;\">Fizik</td>\n<td style=\"width: 309px;\">Antares R1 Versus EVO</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">Brake Rotors</td>\n<td style=\"width: 200px;\">TRP</td>\n<td style=\"width: 309px;\">TRP-25, 160/140mm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">Bottom Bracket</td>\n<td style=\"width: 200px;\">FSA</td>\n<td style=\"width: 309px;\">Pressfit PF-30</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">Crankset</td>\n<td style=\"width: 200px;\">Rotor</td>\n<td style=\"width: 309px;\">Aldhu, 175mm</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">Chainring</td>\n<td style=\"width: 200px;\">Rotor</td>\n<td style=\"width: 309px;\">Aldhu DM Oval Spidering, 50/34</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 207px;\">Groupset</td>\n<td style=\"width: 200px;\">SRAM</td>\n<td style=\"width: 309px;\">RED eTap HRD</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

That’s how I used to do it on my early road bikes. These days however, I have the upper part of the bar and the hoods as a straight extension parallel or slightly upwards to the ground. The hoods have moved upwards a lot without pointing upwards. They are the place where my hands sit most of the time. I do most of the climbing out of the saddle and when I’m not in the drops on the flats or while descending, my hands generally grab the hoods. I place my hands on top of the bars only when climbing seated. With age I imagine that my stems are going to grow shorter, they may come up and sit on spacers and the bars will probably rotate upwards further. As always, I’ll let comfort be my guide.

            "content_html": "<p>I got into cycling with <a href=\"https://collideous.github.io/old-mountain-bikes/\">mountain bikes</a>. After several years of trail riding me and a few friends decided to do some <a href=\"https://collideous.github.io/tags/road-cycling/\">road cycling</a> as well. In 1992 I bought a Trek 5200 from my local bike shop. I rode it through the Jura and through the Seeland a lot, but left it at home during my language year in California in 94/95. It went with me to Sonoma County, when I moved there in 1997. For 4 more years it was the bike I used to climb <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cavedale+Rd,+California,+USA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Cavedale Road</a> just outside Sonoma and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pine+Flat+Rd,+California,+USA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Pine Flats</a> after I moved to Santa Rosa. It became my daily commuter after I bought a Litespeed Ultimate until the drive-side chain stay broke in 2006. The bike had a lifetime warranty and Trek USA gave me a Trek Madone 5.2 as a replacement, even though I no longer had the purchase receipt from my Swiss LBS. The Madone 5.2 was built up with the components from the 5200 and took over as my commuter bike; first in Santa Rosa and later in Biel, Switzerland after we moved across the pond. In Switzerland, I upgraded it to a newer Ultegra groupset including Ultegra wheels and sold it in 2010 to make room for another bike. The Litespeed Ultimate was the road bike I owned and rode the longest. It took me across every climb in Sonoma County and climbed across the Chasseral countless times. It served as a single-speed commuter after I built a Neilpryde Alize. In 2014 I bought a fairly inexpensive Volagi Viaje frameset, which forever changed road cycling for me. I went back to what I call a traditional road bike when I built a Ritte Snob Disc. Had I known back then where the Volagi would be taking me, I would have in all likeliness not purchased the Ritte. As gorgeous as this bike is, it was born under a somewhat unlucky star. After two rides, the Enve fork <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/22448281040/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">broke</a>. A few weeks later, Enve actually had to recall that fork. Ritte was great though and sent me a replacement fork in the matching paint. I rode the bike for a couple of years and loved it, but ultimately the Volagi with room for much wider tires took over. When I bought my third Volagi and sold the first one, I decided to move the SRAM eTap HRD groupset from the first Volagi to the Ritte. But before doing so, I wanted a small paint damage on the steerer tube repaired. The fork replacement years earlier came with a lower headset change from 1 1/4\" to 1 1/2\". Extracting the lower cup and pressing in a new one caused the paint to come off. The paint shop I hired for the repair then realized that a small local paint repair would never be 100%, so we repainted the whole bike. A move in 2019 and the addition of a Nordest Albarda <a href=\"https://collideous.github.io/allroad-cycling/\">allroad</a> bike halted the completion of the Ritte, but finally in 2020 it was carefully put back together. So, there are currently three road bikes in my stable; the Ritte put together with old and new parts, the third Volagi Viaje built with a NOS frameset I had found online in 2018 and an inexpensive Nordest Albarda also built with a mix of old and new parts. Here's the list of the road bikes I've owned over the years.</p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 350px; white-space: nowrap;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 100%;

            "content_html": "<p>I started gravel grinding years before it became a thing in Switzerland. At the time gravel-specific bikes didn’t really exist so my first two gravel bikes were pure cyclo-cross bikes. I did a bunch of gravel riding for seven years and then moved on in 2018. I can still be found on gravel, but now it’s generally to get from one paved road to another, which are not otherwise connected. When I was gravel grinding, I always planned my rides to be on gravel <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">all</span> the time. Gravel rides did not cut into my road riding, but cut heavily into my mountain biking. The more I spent on gravel, the less I spent on trails. So, I currently no longer own such a bike, although I may get back to it in the future.</p>\n<p>Back in 2011 I bought a Focus Mares CX2.0 cross bike to do gravel rides when I didn't feel like mountain biking. A few years later, in October 2014, I replaced it with a Focus Mares CX 0.0. I only kept that bike for a year and bought a second Volagi Viaje the following spring. This one was set up as a gravel bike with a 1x11 drivetrain. Loved it; the stealth black frame, the re-purposed Enve AM 29er/700C wheels and mostly how the bike performed. </p>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 350px; white-space: nowrap;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 100%; background-color: #ecf0f1; height: 50px;\" colspan=\"3\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157641611165484\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Volagi Viaje</a> (sold)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"height: 300px;\" rowspan=\"6\"><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/volagi-viaje-cx.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/volagi-viaje-cx-xs.jpg 300w ,https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/volagi-viaje-cx-sm.jpg 480w ,https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/volagi-viaje-cx-md.jpg 768w ,https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/volagi-viaje-cx-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/volagi-viaje-cx-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/volagi-viaje-cx-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"Volagi Viaje CX\" width=\"3667\" height=\"2145\"></figure></td>\n<td>First ride</td>\n<td>Mar 26, 2016</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Last ride</td>\n<td>Jun 22, 2018</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total rides</td>\n<td>91</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Distance</td>\n<td>5'769 km</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Elevation</td>\n<td>146'753 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hours</td>\n<td>292 h</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 350px; white-space: nowrap;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 100%; background-color: #ecf0f1; height: 50px;\" colspan=\"3\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157648660139599\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Focus Mares</a> CX 0.0 (sold)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"height: 300px;\" rowspan=\"6\"><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/focus-mares-cx00.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/focus-mares-cx00-xs.jpg 300w ,https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/focus-mares-cx00-sm.jpg 480w ,https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/focus-mares-cx00-md.jpg 768w ,https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/focus-mares-cx00-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/focus-mares-cx00-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/focus-mares-cx00-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"Focus Mares CX 0.0\" width=\"3485\" height=\"2140\"></figure></td>\n<td>First ride</td>\n<td>Oct 31, 2014</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Last ride</td>\n<td>Dec 30, 2015</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total rides</td>\n<td>34</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Distance</td>\n<td>2'161 km</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Elevation</td>\n<td>54'134 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hours</td>\n<td>111 h</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 391px; white-space: nowrap;\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th style=\"width: 100%; background-color: #ecf0f1; height: 50px;\" colspan=\"3\"><a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/albums/72157627946545816\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Focus Mares CX 2.0</a> (sold)</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"height: 341px;\" rowspan=\"6\"><figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/focus-mares-cx20.jpg\" sizes=\"(max-width: 48em) 100vw, 768px\" srcset=\"https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/focus-mares-cx20-xs.jpg 300w ,https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/focus-mares-cx20-sm.jpg 480w ,https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/focus-mares-cx20-md.jpg 768w ,https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/focus-mares-cx20-lg.jpg 1024w ,https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/focus-mares-cx20-xl.jpg 1360w ,https://collideous.github.io/media/posts/26/responsive/focus-mares-cx20-2xl.jpg 1600w\"  alt=\"Focus Mares CX 2.0\" width=\"3264\" height=\"2448\"></figure></td>\n<td>First ride</td>\n<td>Oct 21, 2011</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Last ride</td>\n<td>Nov 2, 2013</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Total rides</td>\n<td>64</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Distance</td>\n<td>2'801 km</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Elevation</td>\n<td>81'871 m</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Hours</td>\n<td>151 h</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",

            "summary": "<p class=\"dropcap\">My first fat-bike, the Big Boy, was designed at a time when fat-bikes ran 135/170 hubs and 3.8-4.0 inch tires. It was also designed with a year-round use in mind. Good for snow but fun on dirt trails, too. I kept updating it over the years and after several winters it became clear that fat-biking totally is my thing. So, five years later I pulled the trigger on a snow-specific <a href=\"https://www.44bikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FortyFour</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/44bikes/albums/72157698403581765\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snakedriver</a> with 27.5” wheels with room for 4.5” tires. The geometry was optimized for snow riding. A slightly lower BB to bring the center of gravity down, a longer wheelbase and a slacker head tube for more directional stability. Hub spacing grew to 150/197 and the frame received a <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/44bikes/42672828874/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">T47 BB shell</a>. Kris also convinced me to use a dropper, for which I did see a number of benefits for snow rides. After time with a dropper, I would now also equip any dirt MTB with one. I can ride without, but it’s truly nice to make use of one. As with all my other bikes, the Snakedriver was equipped with a <a href=\"https://collideous.github.io/45-is-the-new-20/\">Jones bar</a>. In this case an H-Bar Loop Carbon 710. Winter rides often happen at night in the dark, and the Loop was the perfect bar for a <a href=\"https://collideous.github.io/custom-carbon-front-light-mount/\">custom front light mount</a>. In February 2019 I studded the <a href=\"https://www.trekbikes.com/us/en_US/equipment/cycling-components/bike-tires/fat-bike-tires/bontrager-gnarwhal-fat-bike-tire/p/13271/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bontrager Gnarwhal</a> tires. How did I fat-bike without them for 5 years?</p>\n",
            "content_html": "<p class=\"dropcap\">My first fat-bike, the Big Boy, was designed at a time when fat-bikes ran 135/170 hubs and 3.8-4.0 inch tires. It was also designed with a year-round use in mind. Good for snow but fun on dirt trails, too. I kept updating it over the years and after several winters it became clear that fat-biking totally is my thing. So, five years later I pulled the trigger on a snow-specific <a href=\"https://www.44bikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">FortyFour</a>, a <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/44bikes/albums/72157698403581765\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snakedriver</a> with 27.5” wheels with room for 4.5” tires. The geometry was optimized for snow riding. A slightly lower BB to bring the center of gravity down, a longer wheelbase and a slacker head tube for more directional stability. Hub spacing grew to 150/197 and the frame received a <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/44bikes/42672828874/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">T47 BB shell</a>. Kris also convinced me to use a dropper, for which I did see a number of benefits for snow rides. After time with a dropper, I would now also equip any dirt MTB with one. I can ride without, but it’s truly nice to make use of one. As with all my other bikes, the Snakedriver was equipped with a <a href=\"https://collideous.github.io/45-is-the-new-20/\">Jones bar</a>. In this case an H-Bar Loop Carbon 710. Winter rides often happen at night in the dark, and the Loop was the perfect bar for a <a href=\"https://collideous.github.io/custom-carbon-front-light-mount/\">custom front light mount</a>.
