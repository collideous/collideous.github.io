Hope is essentially the only manufacturer that still offers disc brakes in a variety of colors. The XCR with E4 calipers were the brakes I was waiting for.</p>\n\n<p>The lever is gorgeously CNC-machined, is rather minimalist, and therefore light-weight. The E4 caliper offers a cleaner hose routing than the old Formula R1. The caliper is CNC'd in one piece from high-grade forged aluminum billet. This pair of brakes should have more bite than my old R1s; the only negative - is DOT. The <a href=\"https://www.rideformula.com/products/mtb-brakes/cura4/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Curas</a> on my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/stooge-mk5/\">Stooge</a> and <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/fortyfour-snakedriver/\">Snakedriver</a> use mineral oil. All my road and gravel bikes use DOT fluid, so it is just one more bike requiring that brake fluid.

The bike was already equipped with previous generation RX4 calipers. In our old, very humid basement, I always had issues with galvanic corrosion of aluminum components, particularly when they were exposed to sweat during a ride. I always had to clean my front hubs with WD40 before putting the bike in the basement, if sweat had dripped on them during hot summer rides. That’s a bit harder to do to a brake caliper bolted to the fork. The RX4 caliper corroded in one spot, which bothered me a little. It didn’t bother me enough to replace it, but with the RX4+ Hope <a href=\"https://www.hopetech.com/_repository/1/documents/RX4_Technical_Specs_2021.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">refined</a> these road calipers in several ways. All of the changes benefitted my Volagi Viaje. The hose-inlet angle on the old caliper had a sharp 20º angle. This pushed the hose against the chainstay in the back and caused a sharp bend of the hose up front. Hope reduced this angle to 10º allowing the hoses to be straighter. I also reached the sideways adjustment limit when trying to center the rear caliper. With the RX4+, Hope increased the adjustment from 2.5 to 3.5 mm. Lastly, Hope increased the piston diameters from 2x14 mm and 2x11 mm to 2x16 mm and 2x14 mm. I am certain that this will be noticeable.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"5\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/90/gallery/updating-brakes-06.jpg\" data-size=\"3820x2015\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/90/gallery/updating-brakes-06-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Hope RX4+ black calipers.\" width=\"720\" height=\"380\"></a>\n<figcaption>Hope RX4+.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/90/gallery/updating-brakes-07.jpg\" data-size=\"3667x2272\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/90/gallery/updating-brakes-07-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Hope RX4+ black calipers.\" width=\"720\" height=\"446\"></a>\n<figcaption>Hope RX4+.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/90/gallery/updating-brakes-08.jpg\" data-size=\"3748x2167\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/90/gallery/updating-brakes-08-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Hope RX4+ and RX4 calipers.\" width=\"720\" height=\"416\"></a>\n<figcaption>RX4+ vs. RX4.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/90/gallery/updating-brakes-09.jpg\" data-size=\"1936x1501\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/90/gallery/updating-brakes-09-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"RX4+ verus RX4 brake pads.\" width=\"720\" height=\"558\"></a>\n<figcaption>Brake pads.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/90/gallery/updating-brakes-10.jpg\" data-size=\"1730x2103\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/90/gallery/updating-brakes-10-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"RX4+ verus RX4 brake pads.\" width=\"720\" height=\"875\"></a>\n<figcaption>Larger pads.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>On May 7th, Chris King introduced their <a href=\"https://chrisking.com/blogs/news/gen-4-hub-system\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Gen 4 hub system</a> with the main changes being universalized drivers and axles. The goal was to make parts cross-compatible, easily swappable, less expensive, and backward-compatible. I’ve had several pairs of <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/tags/r45d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">R45D</a> hubs. If you wanted to swap an HG drive shell for XDR on an old hub, you also had to buy a new axle. Now, all drive shells and axles are cross-compatible. One bummer is that Chris King is still not making a <a href=\"https://chrisking.com/collections/all-small-parts/gen4+r45d-centerlock\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">135x10mm QR axle</a> for R45D hubs. I understand that all modern road and gravel bikes use thru-axles these days but there are still plenty of QR-equipped bikes being ridden and custom builders still make them now and then. Industry 9 and Hope offer QR end caps for their latest generation hubs. It would be a simple thing to add such an axle.</p>",

There are obvious advantages to doing that. If you own a bike for only a year, you won’t need to do a lot of maintenance. You will replace brake pads, maybe the chain, and you may go through a few tires depending on your mileage. It is unlikely that you will replace anything else. I am not like that. If I like a bike, it will be with me for several years. Many of my bikes have undergone multiple transformations in those years. My <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/old-mountain-bikes/\">44 Big Boy</a> fat bike went through four wheelsets, three cranksets, and two forks. Only the frame kit, calipers, saddle, and cranks are still original on my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/\">Nordest Albarda</a>. It went from 2x11, 2x12 to 1x12 SRAM Force AXS, and I have ridden it on three different wheelsets.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"5\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/89/gallery/another-round-changes-05.jpg\" data-size=\"3705x2084\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/89/gallery/another-round-changes-05-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Ritte Snod Disc in a 2x12 setup.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>2x12 setup.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/89/gallery/another-round-changes-06.jpg\" data-size=\"3635x2045\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/89/gallery/another-round-changes-06-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Ritte Snob Disc 2024 edition.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>2024 edition.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/89/gallery/another-round-changes-07.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/89/gallery/another-round-changes-07-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"SRAM Red AXS derailleur.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Derailleur.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/89/gallery/another-round-changes-08.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/89/gallery/another-round-changes-08-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Rotor Aldhu cranks and chainrings.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Chainrings.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/89/gallery/another-round-changes-09.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/89/gallery/another-round-changes-09-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"SRAM Red AXS brake/shift levers.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Levers.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>In October, I updated both my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda-2023-update/\">Nordest Albarda</a> and my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-2024-update/\">Volagi Viaje</a>.

The manufacturer had already created the product page for the 2024 model but made those pages unavailable to general website visitors. Somehow, however, Google's search engine crawler managed to index it. I stumbled upon it while doing an image search. I liked the bike in its previous iterations and absolutely love the <a href=\"https://www.marinbikes.com/bikes/2024-headlands-frame-kit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">colors</a> they picked for 2024. Since I have reached my “N+1” limit, currently <strong>seven</strong>, I thought about sending my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/\">Nordest Albarda</a> frame into temporary retirement and using its components to build the new bike. I changed my mind. The Nordest Albarda, with its recent 1x12 <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda-2023-update/\">update</a>, is still a sweet-looking bike. With the additional AR25 wheels, I now have a total of four wheelsets that can be mounted to either the MGX12 or the Nordest. Now that the Nordest no longer has a front derailleur, I can mount larger 700C tires. The limit of the frame is probably 48mm. The fork, surprisingly, can accept a 55mm Antelope Hill. I will keep a sharp eye on that frame kit, however. If an online retailer has my size and massively drops the price at the end of the season, I might swoop one up.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/84/gallery/new-wheels-mgx12-04.jpg\" data-size=\"3705x2084\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/84/gallery/new-wheels-mgx12-04-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Hope Pro5 Centerlock front hub.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Front hub.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/84/gallery/new-wheels-mgx12-05.jpg\" data-size=\"3469x1951\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/84/gallery/new-wheels-mgx12-05-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Laser edged LB logo.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>LB logo.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/84/gallery/new-wheels-mgx12-06.jpg\" data-size=\"3502x1970\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/84/gallery/new-wheels-mgx12-06-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Hope Pro5 Centerlock rear hub.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Rear hub.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/84/gallery/new-wheels-mgx12-07.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/84/gallery/new-wheels-mgx12-07-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The bike in its latest setup.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Latest setup.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p><u><i>Tool-topic</i></u>: To install the Hope Centerlock lockring on the rear hub, the black thru-axle end cap needs to be removed. Unlike many other hubs, the end cap can be taken off and installed while the brake rotor and lockring are in place. However, it can be quite challenging to remove the end cap with just two fingers, and there is nothing for a tool to safely grip onto. To solve this problem, I purchased a Wheels Manufacturing <a href=\"https://wheelsmfg.com/presses-tools/bearing-extractors/6001-6801-6901-12mm-sealed-bearing-extractor.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">12mm bearing extractor</a>, which can grab the end cap from the inside. It is extremely simple to pull the end cap off with such an extractor. I should have bought one a long time ago.</p>",

I have a <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/\">Nordest Albarda</a> with SRAM Red XPLR AXS and a <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12/\">Marin Gestalt</a> X with equivalent Rival components. There is no functional difference between the two. Red looks a little different and is a bit lighter. That's it for twice the price. I paid EUR 699.00 for a <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-sl/\">Volagi Viaje</a> frameset and CHF 1'600.00 for a complete Marin Gestalt X10. I built two of my best road/gravel bikes with those. I see no need to spend an arm and a leg on a carbon bike. They may offer improved aerodynamics, light weight, maximum stiffness, a few watts, and ultimate performance. Does it matter to a rider like myself? For a professional cyclist who aims to win the Tour, every marginal gain counts. However, for the average Joe like myself, shedding a few pounds of belly fat will have a much greater impact than investing thousands of dollars in a UCI-approved race bike.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/88/gallery/dream-bike-job-04.jpg\" data-size=\"3751x2110\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/88/gallery/dream-bike-job-04-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Romontberg, here I come.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Climbing.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/88/gallery/dream-bike-job-05.jpg\" data-size=\"3733x2100\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/88/gallery/dream-bike-job-05-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Time for some tailwind.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Tailwind.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/88/gallery/dream-bike-job-06.jpg\" data-size=\"3594x2022\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/88/gallery/dream-bike-job-06-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"A few more meters to climb.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Reaching the top.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The bike industry is in crisis. Warehouses are filled with unsold bikes. Despite heavily discounted prices for new bikes, there is no demand. BMC has recently <a href=\"https://road.cc/content/news/bmc-applies-cut-hours-its-remaining-staff-306681\">requested</a> state wage subsidies. Many others are struggling, with some even having filed for <a href=\"https://www.bicycleretailer.com/industry-news/2023/02/09/parlee-cycles-files-chapter-11-bankruptcy-protection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">bankruptcy</a>. While there are multiple factors contributing to this situation, bike prices are certainly a major issue. Charging over $8000 for carbon bikes with integrated cable routing? Sorry, but no thanks. The road bikes I ride cost less than half of that. They do the job, and they do it well. The development of hiding brake hoses and shifter cables inside the handlebar, stem, and fork over the past couple of years has undoubtedly created some clean-looking bikes. However, I don’t particularly like the massive stems and spacers that come along with it, especially on top of a steel or titanium frame. The clean look was achieved at the expense of ease of maintenance and adjustability. Changing a stem or cleaning the internals of a headset are jobs that can easily be done in under half an hour. On a fully integrated bike, such a simple job now requires several hours. As a bike mechanic, such a bike will never be the bike of my dreams but rather the bike of my nightmares.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/88/gallery/dream-bike-job-07.jpg\" data-size=\"3624x2038\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/88/gallery/dream-bike-job-07-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The turnaround point.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Turnaround.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/88/gallery/dream-bike-job-08.jpg\" data-size=\"4096x2304\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/88/gallery/dream-bike-job-08-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Climbing in Plagne.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Plagne.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/88/gallery/dream-bike-job-09.jpg\" data-size=\"4096x2304\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/88/gallery/dream-bike-job-09-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The sky in many colors.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Colors.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Although it may not be the conventional choice for a road bike, my Marin Gestalt X12 is the best one I have built. If I could have any bike, it would be a titanium replica of it. It would not offer any performance improvement compared to the aluminum version. It would only cost a lot more and be cool. And sometimes, it's all right to slaughter one's piggy bank to realize cool things. These past couple of years, I have found a new challenge, though. It is to build awesome bikes on a reasonable budget. It is easy to put together a jaw-droppingly cool bike on a large budget. It takes more time to plan, search, and compare to do the same on a limited budget. With the cost of living on the rise and my retirement approaching, I will likely opt for bikes that simply do the job. Dream bikes will be the things to drool over on Instagram.</p>",

The bike received the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12-on-new-wheels/\">new 700C wheels</a> and seatpost from my Marin. I also exchanged the Zipp Service Course SL stem. An older gloss-black one made room for a new one in matte-black. I also installed new rotors - the <a href=\"https://bucklos.co/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Bucklos</a> Centerlock rotors I mentioned in my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/centerlock-rotor-comparison/\">previous post</a>. I am stoked about the result. The bike went through several <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda-2021-update/\">iterations</a> since 2019, and this is the best one yet. On Sunday, I had to do something about my cabin fever. I drove to Prés d’Orvin before sunrise to fat-bike the snow-covered mountains. It was an <a href=\"https://www.strava.com/activities/10600090821\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">epic morning</a>. I did not see another human being for several hours. I had that icy winter wonderland all to myself. A bluish sky to the north and a cloudy one to the south created some unreal colors.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/87/gallery/fat-biking-2024-04.jpg\" data-size=\"4096x2304\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/87/gallery/fat-biking-2024-04-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Windy and icy as heck.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Wind and ice.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/87/gallery/fat-biking-2024-05.jpg\" data-size=\"4096x1917\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/87/gallery/fat-biking-2024-05-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Love that sun.\" width=\"720\" height=\"337\"></a>\n<figcaption>That sun.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/87/gallery/fat-biking-2024-06.jpg\" data-size=\"4004x2251\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/87/gallery/fat-biking-2024-06-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"I'm almost there.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Almost there.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Utilizing my expertise in reading snow, intimate knowledge of the terrain, and keen awareness of how the wind shapes, moves, and hardens the large snow surfaces to the north of the peak, I navigated my way to the Chasseral. This is the ultimate essence of fat-biking for me. It is not sufficient to just be a skilled mountain biker who studies GPS tracks, elevation profiles, and maps to fully enjoy fat-biking in a country that has never fully embraced the sport. Understanding how the winter alters the local environment is crucial. This element of the sport is something you don’t need on the road, on gravel, or dirt. However, it is a huge part of what makes fat-biking so addictive.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/87/gallery/fat-biking-2024-07.jpg\" data-size=\"3945x2218\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/87/gallery/fat-biking-2024-07-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"That's why I fat-bike.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Fat-biking.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/87/gallery/fat-biking-2024-08.jpg\" data-size=\"4096x2304\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/87/gallery/fat-biking-2024-08-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The Crest Trail is best ridden in the winter.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Crest Trail.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/87/gallery/fat-biking-2024-09.jpg\" data-size=\"3726x2096\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/87/gallery/fat-biking-2024-09-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Just me and the Chasseral antenna.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Antenna.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>I have stopped doing <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/year-2020-in-review/\">end-of-year</a> reviews. There just aren’t any epic adventures to look back to since I cannot venture beyond my local area to explore new trails or roads. While I used to go on 56-57 fat-bike rides <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/ride-type-statistics/\">annually</a> from 2017 to 2019, I have only done three snow rides in 2023. The difference? I used to be able to load my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/tags/fat-biking/\">fat bike</a> into the car and drive 10-30 minutes to trailheads at higher elevations. In terms of the total number of rides I took in 2023, I only managed 100, which is a far cry from my peak between <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/annual-stats-by-month/\">2016 and 2018</a>, when I averaged 165 rides per year. Out of those 100 rides, 72 were on pavement, sometimes with a bit of gravel mixed in. My annual ride distance and time have reached an all-time low, with only 3,147 kilometers and 193 hours, compared to my peak in 2018 when I rode 8,752 kilometers and spent a staggering 586 hours in the saddle. My goal for the years ahead is to gradually get back to that level, maybe as early as 2026.</p>",

You don’t need that.</p>\n\n<p>I never had the luxury of owning a large enough house in which I could set up a permanent workshop. In the small townhouse, I rented in the US, I wrenched on my bikes outside on the <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/250774966\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">porch</a>. We have a spacious basement in the house that we are renting now. The room houses a laundry machine, a dryer, as well as a hot water boiler. I store my bikes on racks to the left and right side of that boiler. The center area is our laundry space. We filled the front third with metal shelves and wine racks along the walls. It offers plenty of space for me to work on bikes whenever necessary. I covered that area with carpet to avoid staining the basement floor. I do much of the bike maintenance either sitting on an old step stool or sitting on the floor.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"5\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/85/gallery/minimalist-workshop-01.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/85/gallery/minimalist-workshop-01-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"My bike work stand.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Work stand.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/85/gallery/minimalist-workshop-02.jpg\" data-size=\"3565x2005\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/85/gallery/minimalist-workshop-02-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"My bike workspace.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Workspace.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/85/gallery/minimalist-workshop-03.jpg\" data-size=\"3296x1854\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/85/gallery/minimalist-workshop-03-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"A simple folding work stand.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Folding work stand.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/85/gallery/minimalist-workshop-04.jpg\" data-size=\"3531x1986\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/85/gallery/minimalist-workshop-04-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"My toolbox.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Toolbox.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/85/gallery/minimalist-workshop-05.jpg\" data-size=\"2232x3328\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/85/gallery/minimalist-workshop-05-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Bike storage in the back of our basement.\" width=\"720\" height=\"1074\"></a>\n<figcaption>Bike storage.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>If I had enough space, would I set up a bike workshop with a sturdy workbench and pegboards? A well-organized workspace makes servicing bikes easier and more efficient. Efficiency is important to a bike shop mechanic. Nevertheless, for a weekend warrior like myself, does it matter if it takes 15 minutes to bleed the brakes or half an hour? I own way too much stuff already, so I would not want to accumulate yet more stuff to create a workspace that I would only use once a week, if not less frequently. During my singlehood, I did not own a TV. I had very few possessions. Once you are married, stuff quickly accumulates. Stuff can also easily start to pile up with a hobby like cycling. I have made it a habit not to hold onto old components. I sell them through classified ads on <a href=\"https://www.anibis.ch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Anibis</a> or place them on <a href=\"https://www.ebay.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">eBay</a>. Currently, I have too many bikes, and I plan to reduce the number in the coming years by avoiding replacements. There are certain tasks that I am unable to do using the tools in my small bike toolbox because they require specialized and often prohibitively expensive tools that are just silly for a weekend hobbyist to own. They are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>facing and reaming head tubes</li>\n<li>pressing in headsets</li>\n<li>chasing and facing bottom bracket shells</li>\n<li>lacing and truing wheels</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For this, I rely on my <a href=\"https://www.47grad-nord.ch/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">local bike shop</a>. They have the proper professional tools and can do this far better and far more efficiently than I ever could.</p>",

Specifically, when I exceed 50 kph with head and crosswinds on open descents that are not too steep, the steering becomes wobbly and insecure.</p>\n\n<p>At slower speeds or steeper descents, the instability is not present. There are two possible causes for this. Firstly, the 55mm wide Antelope Hill tires and the 40mm tall WG44 rims create a large surface area, making the front wheel more susceptible to wind gusts. Secondly, the <a href=\"https://bikeinsights.com/bike-geometries/636a376a032291001d24e0b4-2023-marin-bikes-gestalt-x10-base-l\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">slack geometry</a> of the Gestalt X12 could be a factor. The long front triangle and slack head tube angle move the front wheel further from the rider, changing the weight distribution and putting less weight on the front wheel. This might explain why the bike descends well on steeper roads as more of my weight shifts forward. I want a bike to feel sharp and precise, so I have some testing to do.</p>\n<h4>Test #1 - New wheels with 44mm Snoqualmie Pass tires</h4>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Wheels</span>: Hope Pro5 Centerlock thru-axle hubs, Light Bicycle WG44 high-profile rims, René Herse 700C x 44 Snoqualmie Pass tires</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-01.jpg\" data-size=\"4096x2304\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-01-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The road up the Romontberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-02.jpg\" data-size=\"4096x2304\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-02-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The road up the Romontberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-03.jpg\" data-size=\"4096x2304\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-03-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The road up to Plagne.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Plagne.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-04.jpg\" data-size=\"3699x2081\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-04-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"On the way to Selzach.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Selzach.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>This setup feels incredible. The bike is a nimble climber, an agile descender, and quick on flats, too. The smaller tires require more air pressure, about 2.8 bars (40 psi). They are still comfortable but don’t offer the smoothness of a 55mm tire. They are noticeably faster than their larger siblings on gravel. They look and feel very aerodynamic. The front wheel cuts through the air like a hand-forged Katana, and the steering is as sharp as one. I'm glad about that. At least I have not built the wrong wheelset.</p>\n<h4>Test #2 - Old wheels with 55mm Antelope Hill tires</h4>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Wheels</span>: Chris King R45D Centerlock thru-axle hubs, Nox Composites Citico low-profile rims, René Herse 700C x 55 Antelope Hill tires</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-05.jpg\" data-size=\"4096x2304\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-05-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The bottom of the Romontberg climb.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-06.jpg\" data-size=\"3421x1924\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-06-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"At the foot of the Romontberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-07.jpg\" data-size=\"3890x2188\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-07-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"A third into the Romontberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-08.jpg\" data-size=\"4012x2257\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-08-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Halfway into the Romontberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The Antelope Hill tire is the tire I would like to use on this bike. I would go down one size to the 700C x 48 <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/700c/700c-x-48-hatcher-pass-tc-tire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hatcher Pass</a>, but I wouldn't go any smaller. The 55mm tires, paired with low-profile rims, are borderline criminal. They don't hold me back while climbing and offer a crazy amount of grip on the descents. I rode this setup on the descent, where the tires on the WG44 rims felt awful. I also took this setup to the ultimate descent from my Hausberg, the Grenchenberg. This is a pothole-covered, rock-littered, and bumpy downhill. The bigger the tires, the faster this road can be ridden. Needless to say, the Antelope Hill tires are made for such terrain.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion - Large tires on high-profile rims are not for the MGX12</h4>\n<p>A new wheelset with low-profile rims is necessary. The Nox wheels would do the job, but they are seven years old and now serve as spare wheels. I often mount knobbier tires on them and use them during the winter months.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-09.jpg\" data-size=\"3537x1990\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-09-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Reaching the top of the Romontberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-10.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-10-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Between Plagne and the Romontberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Plagne.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-11.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-11-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Climbing my Hausberg the Grenchenberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Hausberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-12.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-12-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"At the top of the Grenchenberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Grenchenberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>There were two Light Bicycle rims I was considering: the <a href=\"https://www.lightbicycle.com/AR25-Disc-Carbon-Gravel-Bike-Rim-700c-24mm-Wide-25mm-Deep.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AR25</a> gravel rim and the <a href=\"https://www.lightbicycle.com/xc930-super-light-xc-carbon-rim-270g-tubeless-ready.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">XC930</a> cross-country rim. The Light Bicycle AR25 rim has a depth of only 25mm and weighs 250g with an inner width of 24mm. That’s an impressive weight. The XC930 is only 22mm tall, weighs only 270g, and is as wide as the WG44, 30mm. Being an MTB rim, it is only available hookless. This makes them only suitable for high-volume and low-pressure tires, limiting their potential use. The AR25, as the lightest 700C gravel rim that Light Bicycle has developed, would be much more versatile. It has a hybrid hook bead, which allows for higher tire pressures and can be used for a wide range of tire widths (28-50). My wheels often move from one bike to another. The AR25 is the better choice for that. A pair of AR25 rims come with a weight saving of 260g against the Citico and a whopping 400g savings against the WG44.</p>",

Bike stores, both online and physical, struggled to keep up with the surging demand for bikes and parts. The bike industry collectively saw the post-pandemic years through rose-tinted glasses. They cranked up production and filled inventories. When inflation rose, prices climbed while real wages dropped.

During the autumn season, I revisited the website to search for cycling jackets, long-sleeved jerseys, vests, and bib shorts. I found two brands, <a href=\"https://spexcel.aliexpress.com/store/2219030\">Spexcel</a> from Shenzhen and <a href=\"https://mykilometres.aliexpress.com/store/912228023\">My Kilometre Sports</a> from Wuhan, China, that offer up-to-date designs and high-quality materials.

The vests are made with advanced materials and clever construction. The same can be said about their bib shorts, which provide a lot of value for the price.

With my measly <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/patrickstrahm/followers/\">305</a> followers, I guess my circle of influence is large enough to qualify as an ambassador for supplements. What the heck do I need supplements for? It’s not like I have ever switched on my coffee maker in the morning, still half-asleep, with the thought that I needed to supplement my cup of Joe with a dose of multivitamins. And when I am out on a long bike ride, my stomach has never screamed out for a silly protein powder.
