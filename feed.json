I enjoy climbing on my bikes and also like to descend. The new wheels were great for climbing, fast on flat surfaces, and smooth on gravel. However, they were not perfect for descending. Specifically, when I exceed 50 kph with head and crosswinds on open descents that are not too steep, the steering becomes wobbly and insecure.</p>\n\n<p>At slower speeds or steeper descents, the instability is not present. There are two possible causes for this. Firstly, the 55mm wide Antelope Hill tires and the 40mm tall WG44 rims create a large surface area, making the front wheel more susceptible to wind gusts. Secondly, the <a href=\"https://bikeinsights.com/bike-geometries/636a376a032291001d24e0b4-2023-marin-bikes-gestalt-x10-base-l\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">slack geometry</a> of the Gestalt X12 could be a factor. The long front triangle and slack head tube angle move the front wheel further from the rider, changing the weight distribution and putting less weight on the front wheel. This might explain why the bike descends well on steeper roads as more of my weight shifts forward. I want a bike to feel sharp and precise, so I have some testing to do.</p>\n<h4>Test #1 - New wheels with 44mm Snoqualmie Pass tires</h4>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Wheels</span>: Hope Pro5 Centerlock thru-axle hubs, Light Bicycle WG44 high-profile rims, René Herse 700C x 44 Snoqualmie Pass tires</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-01.jpg\" data-size=\"4096x2304\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-01-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The road up the Romontberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-02.jpg\" data-size=\"4096x2304\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-02-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The road up the Romontberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-03.jpg\" data-size=\"4096x2304\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-03-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The road up to Plagne.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Plagne.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-04.jpg\" data-size=\"3699x2081\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-04-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"On the way to Selzach.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Selzach.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>This setup feels incredible. The bike is a nimble climber, an agile descender, and quick on flats, too. The smaller tires require more air pressure, about 2.8 bars (40 psi). They are still comfortable but don’t offer the smoothness of a 55mm tire. They are noticeably faster than their larger siblings on gravel. They look and feel very aerodynamic. The front wheel cuts through the air like a hand-forged Katana, and the steering is as sharp as one. I'm glad about that. At least I have not built the wrong wheelset.</p>\n<h4>Test #2 - Old wheels with 55mm Antelope Hill tires</h4>\n<p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Wheels</span>: Chris King R45D Centerlock thru-axle hubs, Nox Composites Citico low-profile rims, René Herse 700C x 55 Antelope Hill tires</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-05.jpg\" data-size=\"4096x2304\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-05-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The bottom of the Romontberg climb.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-06.jpg\" data-size=\"3421x1924\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-06-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"At the foot of the Romontberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-07.jpg\" data-size=\"3890x2188\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-07-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"A third into the Romontberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-08.jpg\" data-size=\"4012x2257\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-08-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Halfway into the Romontberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The Antelope Hill tire is the tire I would like to use on this bike. I would go down one size to the 700C x 48 <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/700c/700c-x-48-hatcher-pass-tc-tire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hatcher Pass</a>, but I wouldn't go any smaller. The 55mm tires, paired with low-profile rims, are borderline criminal. They don't hold me back while climbing and offer a crazy amount of grip on the descents. I rode this setup on the descent, where the tires on the WG44 rims felt awful. I also took this setup to the ultimate descent from my Hausberg, the Grenchenberg. This is a pothole-covered, rock-littered, and bumpy downhill. The bigger the tires, the faster this road can be ridden. Needless to say, the Antelope Hill tires are made for such terrain.</p>\n<h4>Conclusion - Large tires on high-profile rims are not for the MGX12</h4>\n<p>A new wheelset with low-profile rims is necessary. The Nox wheels would do the job, but they are seven years old and now serve as spare wheels. I often mount knobbier tires on them and use them during the winter months.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-09.jpg\" data-size=\"3537x1990\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-09-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Reaching the top of the Romontberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-10.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-10-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Between Plagne and the Romontberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Plagne.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-11.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-11-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Climbing my Hausberg the Grenchenberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Hausberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-12.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/83/gallery/wheel-tire-testing-12-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"At the top of the Grenchenberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Grenchenberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>There were two Light Bicycle rims I was considering: the <a href=\"https://www.lightbicycle.com/AR25-Disc-Carbon-Gravel-Bike-Rim-700c-24mm-Wide-25mm-Deep.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">AR25</a> gravel rim and the <a href=\"https://www.lightbicycle.com/xc930-super-light-xc-carbon-rim-270g-tubeless-ready.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">XC930</a> cross-country rim. The Light Bicycle AR25 rim has a depth of only 25mm and weighs 250g with an inner width of 24mm. That’s an impressive weight. The XC930 is only 22mm tall, weighs only 270g, and is as wide as the WG44, 30mm. Being an MTB rim, it is only available hookless. This makes them only suitable for high-volume and low-pressure tires, limiting their potential use. The AR25, as the lightest 700C gravel rim that Light Bicycle has developed, would be much more versatile. It has a hybrid hook bead, which allows for higher tire pressures and can be used for a wide range of tire widths (28-50). My wheels often move from one bike to another. The AR25 is the better choice for that. A pair of AR25 rims come with a weight saving of 260g against the Citico and a whopping 400g savings against the WG44.</p>",

When the pandemic hit, factories in the Far East closed, sea ports slowed operations, and the entire supply chain collapsed. People were sent to home office, were no longer able to go to the gym or yoga class, and suddenly discovered cycling. Bike stores, both online and physical, struggled to keep up with the surging demand for bikes and parts. The bike industry collectively saw the post-pandemic years through rose-tinted glasses. They cranked up production and filled inventories. When inflation rose, prices climbed while real wages dropped. Cyclists, both new and seasoned, are feeling the pinch and have not returned to the shops. As 2023 draws to a close, inventories are overflowing with unwanted merchandise, and the industry is offering massive discounts to stay afloat.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/82/gallery/far-east-shopping-01.jpg\" data-size=\"3270x2336\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/82/gallery/far-east-shopping-01-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Spexcel Windproof Cycling Vests.\" width=\"720\" height=\"514\"></a>\n<figcaption>Specxel Vests.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/82/gallery/far-east-shopping-02.jpg\" data-size=\"3066x2190\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/82/gallery/far-east-shopping-02-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Spexcel Cycling Bibs.\" width=\"720\" height=\"514\"></a>\n<figcaption>Spexcel Bib Shorts.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/82/gallery/far-east-shopping-03.jpg\" data-size=\"2192x2730\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/82/gallery/far-east-shopping-03-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Spexcel Cycling Bibs.\" width=\"720\" height=\"897\"></a>\n<figcaption>Spexcel Bib Shorts.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Wiggle, Chain Reaction Cycles, Probikeshop, Bikester, and Fahrrad.de have had another wrench thrown into their spokes.

During the autumn season, I revisited the website to search for cycling jackets, long-sleeved jerseys, vests, and bib shorts. I found two brands, <a href=\"https://spexcel.aliexpress.com/store/2219030\">Spexcel</a> from Shenzhen and <a href=\"https://mykilometres.aliexpress.com/store/912228023\">My Kilometre Sports</a> from Wuhan, China, that offer up-to-date designs and high-quality materials. Both brands have their own online stores on AliExpress. I purchased several windproof vests from <a href=\"https://spexcel.cc/\">Spexcel</a> that are perfect for chilly rides. The vests are made with advanced materials and clever construction. The same can be said about their bib shorts, which provide a lot of value for the price. The long-sleeved jerseys from <a href=\"https://www.mykilometresports.com/\">My Kilometre Sports</a> are equally impressive, with stylish cuts, excellent craftsmanship, and meticulous attention to detail.</p>\n<p>Every once in a while, I receive a DM on Instagram from <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/epnsupplements/\">@EPNsupplements</a> with an offer to become a sponsored athlete. With my measly <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/patrickstrahm/followers/\">305</a> followers, I guess my circle of influence is large enough to qualify as an ambassador for supplements. What the heck do I need supplements for? It’s not like I have ever switched on my coffee maker in the morning, still half-asleep, with the thought that I needed to supplement my cup of Joe with a dose of multivitamins. And when I am out on a long bike ride, my stomach has never screamed out for a silly protein powder. I do, however, often look forward to a cold, post-ride beer. <a href=\"https://health.ucdavis.edu/blog/cultivating-health/the-truth-about-supplements-for-athletes-and-whether-you-should-be-using-them/2023/05\">Research</a> on exercise supplements shows that these products are a useless waste of money and can be potentially toxic to your body. Such supplements only do one thing: fill the pockets of those who sell them.</p>",

My <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12/\">Marin Gestalt X12</a> started rolling on René Herse <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/700c/700cx44-snoqualmie-pass/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Snoqualmie Pass</a> (700x44) tubeless “shoes.” This bike has room for much more, so much, in fact, that 44mm looks skinny.</p>\n\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"5\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/80/gallery/1-schwalbe-one-700x28.jpg\" data-size=\"3127x1876\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/80/gallery/1-schwalbe-one-700x28-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"28 mm Schwalbe One\" width=\"720\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption>Schwalbe One</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/80/gallery/2-compass-barlow-pass-700x38.jpg\" data-size=\"3407x2715\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/80/gallery/2-compass-barlow-pass-700x38-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"38 mm Compass Barlow Pass\" width=\"720\" height=\"574\"></a>\n<figcaption>Compass Barlow Pass</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/80/gallery/3-rene-herse-snoqualmie-pass-700x44.jpg\" data-size=\"3745x2247\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/80/gallery/3-rene-herse-snoqualmie-pass-700x44-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"44 mm René Herse Snoqualmie Pass\" width=\"720\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption>René Herse Snoqualmie Pass</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/80/gallery/4-panaracer-gravelking-650x48.jpg\" data-size=\"3473x1954\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/80/gallery/4-panaracer-gravelking-650x48-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"48 mm Panaracer GravelKing\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Panaracer GravelKing</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/80/gallery/5-rene-herse-antelope-hill-700x55.jpg\" data-size=\"3421x2053\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/80/gallery/5-rene-herse-antelope-hill-700x55-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"55 mm René Herse Antelope Hill\" width=\"720\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption>René Herse Antelope Hill</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>How wide is too wide? I wonder about this question and hope to find the answer on the next leg of my journey. Wide tires fit best on wide rims, so the new wheels use 30mm internal <a href=\"https://www.lightbicycle.com/700C-gravel-bicycle-rims-40mm-wide-44mm-deep-aero-clincher.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">WG44 carbon rims</a> by Light Bicycle.

Tubeless, of course. Light Bicycle used a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/870363693078977/posts/our-new-hybrid-hook-design-aims-to-improve-tire-fitment-even-further-when-the-hy/5659842387464393/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hybrid hook design</a> to improve tire fitment for the WG44 rims. Hookless rims combined with supple tires are an absolute no-go for me. You may be wondering why anyone would ride so much rubber on pavement. Because it’s fun and because it’s fast. Fast? You gotta be kidding. Granted, you may not be winning any KOMs going uphill. But you stand a good chance of grabbing every KOM going downhill. And you’ll do it with confidence and a huge smile on your face. But speed isn’t as much on my mind these days. I’m after grip, security, all-day comfort, and pure fun and pleasure. If 55mm turns out to be too much, I can go back to 44mm or pick a <a href=\"https://www.renehersecycles.com/shop/components/tires/700c/700c-x-48-hatcher-pass-tc-tire/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hatcher Pass</a> 48mm in between.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/80/gallery/marin-gestalt-new-wheels-01.jpg\" data-size=\"3748x2249\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/80/gallery/marin-gestalt-new-wheels-01-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Marin Gestalt X12 with new wheels.\" width=\"720\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption>Marin Gestalt X12</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/80/gallery/marin-gestalt-new-wheels-02.jpg\" data-size=\"3605x2163\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/80/gallery/marin-gestalt-new-wheels-02-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Marin Gestalt X12 with new wheels.\" width=\"720\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption>Marin Gestalt X12</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/80/gallery/marin-gestalt-new-wheels-03.jpg\" data-size=\"3514x2108\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/80/gallery/marin-gestalt-new-wheels-03-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Hope Pro5 rear hub.\" width=\"720\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption>Rear hub</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>I generally pick the Rolls-Royce of bicycle hubs, Chris King, for the kernel of my wheels.

Centerlock, as well. Much more important than the brand, though, is versatility. Bike hubs need to be adaptable and should best be somewhat future-proof. You should always be able to change them from QR to through-axle or vice versa with just a few parts. You should also be able to pick a Shimano HG, SRAM XD/R, or MicroSpline freehub body without needing a new wheel.

They're amazing hubs with an unmatched quality, but they leave a big hole in one's wallet. Instead, I opted for more affordable and extremely versatile <a href=\"https://www.hopetech.com/news/the-all-new-pro-5-hub/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Hope Pro 5</a> hubs. They’re available with all modern freehub bodies and end spacers to suit different frame and axle standards. They're also offered in six anodizations. So, exactly what I want from a pair of hubs. As always, the wheels were masterfully laced by Patrik at <a href=\"https://www.47grad-nord.ch/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">47º Nord</a>.</p>",

Things were a bit fuzzy with the Viaje. Initially, I thought about using the same setup as on the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12/\">Marin Gestalt X12</a>, SRAM Rival AXS XPLR. Then, I noticed that I could get the recently released Force AXS XPLR for only a little bit more money. But I’m using neither of the two. I stumbled upon Garbaruk’s <a href=\"https://www.garbaruk.com/sram-12-speed-axs-rd-cage.html?category=25\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cage kit</a> for SRAM AXS road derailleurs. And I removed just such a derailleur from my Nordest. The most cost-effective way to bring the Viaje into the 1x12 era is to use the SRAM Red AXS derailleur I already have, replace its cage, and buy a pair of Rival AXS shift/brake levers. They’re inexpensive, and their stealth black finish looks cool, too. The Garbaruk cage is black with red pulleys to match the bike’s color scheme.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/81/gallery/volagi-viaje-2024-05.jpg\" data-size=\"3363x1892\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/81/gallery/volagi-viaje-2024-05-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"The new 1x12 drivetrain.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>1x12.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/81/gallery/volagi-viaje-2024-06.jpg\" data-size=\"3227x2420\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/81/gallery/volagi-viaje-2024-06-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"More red with those derailleur pulleys.\" width=\"720\" height=\"540\"></a>\n<figcaption>More red.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/81/gallery/volagi-viaje-2024-07.jpg\" data-size=\"3752x2110\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/81/gallery/volagi-viaje-2024-07-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"SRAM Rival AXS brake/shift levers.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>SRAM Rival.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/81/gallery/volagi-viaje-2024-08.jpg\" data-size=\"3486x1961\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/81/gallery/volagi-viaje-2024-08-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Prologo Scratch M5 Nack saddle.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Prologo saddle.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Here’s the detailed list of changes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crankbrothers Eggbeater 3 pedals</li>\n<li>Garbaruk 44T oval chainring</li>\n<li>Garbaruk rear derailleur cage kit for large cassettes</li>\n<li>Industry 9 Torch XDR freehub</li>\n<li>Prologo Scratch M5 Nack saddle</li>\n<li>Rotor Aldhu 5-bolt 110BCD spider</li>\n<li>SRAM Force FlatTop chain</li>\n<li>SRAM Rival AXS shift/brake levers</li>\n<li>SRAM Red AXS rear derailleur (from Nordest Albarda)</li>\n<li>SRAM XPLR XG-1251 10-44T cassette</li>\n<li>Wolf Tooth 6mm chainring bolts</li>\n</ul>",

They may replace tires, brake pads, chains, and maybe even a cassette. Besides that, a new setup only comes with a new bike. I prefer to hold onto a bike if it’s fun. I also enjoy to keep tuning it. Sometimes, the job at hand is only about replacing old and/or worn parts. Other times, it’s about changing fit and function altogether. The complex interaction between a bike and me depends largely on my own variability. As I’m aging, my physical capabilities are the largest factor in that intricate person-machine relationship. A bike setup that felt right just a few years ago may no longer be right today. Upgrading the machine is, therefore, often about keeping the machinist smile.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/79/gallery/nordest-albarda-2023-04.jpg\" data-size=\"3756x2113\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/79/gallery/nordest-albarda-2023-04-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Rotor Aldhu crankset.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Crankset.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/79/gallery/nordest-albarda-2023-05.jpg\" data-size=\"3691x2076\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/79/gallery/nordest-albarda-2023-05-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"SRAM 10-44T XPLR cassette.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>XPLR cassette.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/79/gallery/nordest-albarda-2023-06.jpg\" data-size=\"3325x1870\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/79/gallery/nordest-albarda-2023-06-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Fouriers 31.8mm seatpost clamp.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Seatpost clamp.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>My human motor was more finely tuned and performed best when matched to a 2x drivetrain with a tightly spaced cassette just a few years ago. Thanks to the latest addition to my bike stable, the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/marin-gestalt-x12/\">Marin Gestalt X12</a>, I discovered that my 54-year-old diesel engine runs quite smoothly when allowed to power a simple 1x12 drivetrain. I love simplification. Getting rid of the front derailleur has lots of benefits. It’s one less battery to keep charged. From a mechanical point of view, a front derailleur is a pretty crude method to move a chain from one chainring to the other. It causes both the chain and the chainrings to wear out faster. Also, I rarely use the smallest three cogs in the big ring (48T). With a 1x12 drivetrain, on the other hand, every cog gets its fair share of work. So, the time has come to match the Nordest Albarda to the preferences of this new old guy.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/79/gallery/nordest-albarda-2023-07.jpg\" data-size=\"3507x1973\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/79/gallery/nordest-albarda-2023-07-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Nordest Albarda in 1x12 setup.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>1x12 setup.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/79/gallery/nordest-albarda-2023-08.jpg\" data-size=\"3612x2032\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/79/gallery/nordest-albarda-2023-08-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Easton EC70 SL 31.8mm, 440mm carbon handlebar.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>New handlebar.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/79/gallery/nordest-albarda-2023-09.jpg\" data-size=\"3609x2030\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/79/gallery/nordest-albarda-2023-09-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"1x12 SRAM XPLR drivetrain.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Drivetrain.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Starting in the fall of 2023, it’s equipped with:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Crankbrothers Eggbeater 3 pedals</li>\n<li>Easton EC70 SL 31.8mm, 440mm carbon handlebar</li>\n<li>Fouriers 31.8mm seat post clamp</li>\n<li>Rotor Aldhu 5-bolt 110BCD spider</li>\n<li>Rotor Aldhu standard 30mm road axle</li>\n<li>SRAM Force FlatTop chain</li>\n<li>SRAM Red XPLR AXS rear derailleur</li>\n<li>SRAM XPLR XG-1251 10-44T cassette</li>\n<li>Wheels Manufacturing BSA-68/73-30 bottom bracket</li>\n<li>Wolf Tooth 42T oval chainring</li>\n<li>Wolf Tooth 6mm chainring bolts</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That said, there’s a chance I’m sending the Nordest Albarda frameset into temporary retirement and move all its components to a new frameset in 2024.

I have not been able to spend the time I would like on the saddle, so rides aren’t long nor particularly adventurous. So, there just isn’t much interesting to report about. This past seven days, I took a staycation and took advantage of the dry, sunny conditions to hit the trails on my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/stooge-mk5/\">Stooge</a>. While some days were at my heat limit, I got out for 3-hour rides daily. The trails were spectacular. Looking at the leaf-covered ground, one felt like being in the middle of autumn. Looking at the foliage, though, autumn seems nowhere yet. That isn’t good. The forests at our latitudes aren’t used to the kind of heat we’re experiencing, and they’re suffering from heat stress. It remains to be seen if our trees are going to carry the beautiful fall colors that they should in the weeks to come or if they’re going to drop their foliage as rapidly as some already have.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"3\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/78/gallery/balconia-04.jpg\" data-size=\"4096x2636\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/78/gallery/balconia-04-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Riding along the Bözingenberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"463\"></a>\n<figcaption>Bözingenberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/78/gallery/balconia-05.jpg\" data-size=\"4096x2926\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/78/gallery/balconia-05-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Climbing the Bözingenberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"514\"></a>\n<figcaption>Bözingenberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/78/gallery/balconia-06.jpg\" data-size=\"3881x2183\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/78/gallery/balconia-06-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Crossing the Bözingenberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Bözingenberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>I’ll return to share a few bike updates In the coming weeks and months.

It was rare to see a <a href=\"https://www.zwift.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zwift</a> activity during the summer months just a year or two ago. Most switch to training indoors when the days get shorter and colder. Now, a considerable number of cyclists trained indoors because the summer of 2023 was too damn hot.</p>\n<p>Cycling, for me, has to be fun, enjoyable, and healthy. Once the thermometer passes 25°C, these three things start to dive, and the higher the relative humidity, the quicker they dive. If the air is dry, it can remain enjoyable at 30+°C. But if it’s muggy, the fun is gone. I also put great importance to only doing what benefits my health, and exercising in the heat is anything but healthy. On the contrary, you unnecessarily stress your body, even damage it, and in the worst case, put yourself in danger.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  </span>A strenuous bike ride can already become dangerous at 30°C and a relative humidity above 55%. <a href=\"https://arielschecklist.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ariel's Checklist</a>, a website with safety guidelines for hiking in the desert, has a tremendous <a href=\"https://arielschecklist.com/wbgt-chart/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">wet bulb temperature chart</a> showing the danger of physical activity at different combinations of temperature and humidity.

Heat waves have paralyzed the American South from east to west. It has hit large parts of Asia, the Middle East, as well as Europe, particularly the Mediterranean. Huge wildfires engulfed Canada, Portugal, Greece, and tropical Hawaii, where the fire that destroyed Lahaina became the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Hawaii_wildfires#Casualties\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">deadliest</a> US blaze in a century. Heat waves also always lead to heavy thunderstorms and flooding. There have been floods in India, Mongolia, California, Slovenia, Italy, and Norway, to name a few. As we're in an <a href=\"https://www.weather.gov/news/230706-ElNino\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">El Niño</a> year, this will continue well into 2024. El Niño transports humidity away from Asia and Australia to North and South America. When <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effects_of_the_El_Ni%C3%B1o%E2%80%93Southern_Oscillation_in_Australia#El_Ni%C3%B1o\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Australia</a> heads into summer, that continent will be a tinderbox. The US West Coast will see lots of floods. Living in California, I experienced El Niño in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1997%E2%80%9398_El_Ni%C3%B1o_event\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">1997-1998</a>. It was regarded as one of the most powerful El Niño Southern Oscillation events in recorded history. And it was quite bad. At the same time, oceans across the globe have reached surface temperatures like we have never seen before. The August heat wave pushed the zero-degree line in the Swiss Alps to <a href=\"https://www.meteoschweiz.admin.ch/ueber-uns/meteoschweiz-blog/de/2023/08/die-rekorde-purzeln.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">5,298 meters</a> above sea level. In other words, every alpine glacier was melting.</p>\n<p>I don't think mankind is going to reverse the civilization-ending trajectory it’s on. Science has known since the 50ies what will happen to the planet when humans burn fossil fuels. The public has been well aware of it since the 80ies. Forty years later, we have done shit about it. People think that governments will somehow fix it. In the meantime, they fly across the globe for a Christmas holiday on a beach in Thailand or board a plane for a shopping weekend in New York. Rather than downsizing, our homes and cars are only getting bigger. The capitalist system that we live in demands that we consume more and more. A larger flat-screen TV every couple of years, a new cell phone every year, new clothes every few months; it's oil to keep our economy running smoothly. Without growth, it would collapse. We're depleting our planet’s resources and heating up its precious atmosphere. I used to think that it'll take a couple more generations until mankind is going to be in trouble. Not anymore. These events are upon us much faster, and we’ll experience them on our own skin.</p>\n<p>In the coming years, natural disasters caused by the climate catastrophe are going to burden First World economies heavily. Heat waves will kill those without the luxury of air-conditioning. The number of refugees currently crossing the Mediterranean Sea will be dwarfed by the millions of climate refugees who will be forced to leave large <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2022/10/11/extreme-heat-heatwave-deaths/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">uninhabitable</a>, equatorial regions in Africa, India, and elsewhere. Europe won’t be welcoming but become a fortress. The Swiss forests I enjoy on my bike, <a href=\"https://www.bafu.admin.ch/bafu/en/home/topics/forest/in-brief.html#:~:text=The%20hot%2C%20dry%20summers%20of,extremes%20or%20even%20died%20off.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">unable to cope</a> with the heat, will start dying off. Like elsewhere in the world, our forests will burn, too. Our water supply will no longer be guaranteed when our <a href=\"https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/society/swiss-glacier-series--0-1-000m-_melting-swiss-glaciers-to-fuel-conflicts-over-water-/45371008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">alpine glaciers</a> are gone. Without enough water, farming will become increasingly difficult. And to come back to cycling, summers will be three months of <a href=\"https://www.zwift.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zwift</a> with the AC on full power, provided the power grid doesn’t collapse.</p>\n<p>Maybe you say, “Oh, Patrick, you’re a pessimist.” I don’t think so. I’m a realist. Forty years ago, there was still time to be optimistic. To be optimistic today is to live in a fantasy. We’re not willing to change our destructive lifestyles. We want our vacations, we want our homes, we want our cars, and we want our stuff. A world on fire won’t change us. Maybe it’ll change our children or grandchildren if they manage to survive, but certainly not us.</p>",

Reach is 63mm longer than my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/\">Nordest Albarda</a> and 68mm longer than my <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/volagi-viaje-sl/\">Volagi Viaje</a>. The Gestalt’s wheelbase is 95mm greater than the Nordest and an enormous 124mm more than the Volagi. It’s a massively <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/the-geometry-of-a-gravel-bike/\">different bike</a>. And that’s the reason I bought one. Some time down the road, I’d love to design the perfect SUB frame for myself. It only makes sense to go down that path with years of cycling under one’s belt, which I have, and countless hours spent on a wide range of bikes. And that one can never have enough.</p>\n\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/76/gallery/first-200km-01.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/76/gallery/first-200km-01-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Evening ride to the Grenchenberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Grenchenberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/76/gallery/first-200km-04.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/76/gallery/first-200km-04-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Another visit to the Grenchenberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Grenchenberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/76/gallery/first-200km-02.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/76/gallery/first-200km-02-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Evening ride to the Grenchenberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Grenchenberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/76/gallery/first-200km-03.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/76/gallery/first-200km-03-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Evening ride to the Grenchenberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Grenchenberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Visually, I love the result. I purposely purchased a large frame. The 440mm reach and 175mm head tube, in combination with a <a href=\"https://www.syntace.com/en_GB/products/stems/mountain-bike/2988/flatforce-44\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Syntace FlatForce 44</a> stem, placed the handlebar where I needed it to be. Having the right look is nice, but optics ultimately don’t matter. A bike has to deliver. And that it does. Built as it is, the bike weighs 8.9 kilograms. Climbing out of the saddle with my hands on the hoods, the Gestalt tackles every climb in a neutral manner. It swings from side to side perfectly harmoniously with my body movement without veering left and right with every pull on the bar. When going downhill, the bike feels fast yet safe. It requires more rider input to initiate a change of direction, but I like controlling a bike with a bit of aggression. It doesn’t offer the best aero position with a 46cm wide gravel bar, but I’m out to have fun and not to win a time trial.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/76/gallery/first-200km-05.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/76/gallery/first-200km-05-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Ride to the Romontberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/76/gallery/first-200km-06.jpg\" data-size=\"3598x2024\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/76/gallery/first-200km-06-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Climbing up the Romontberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/76/gallery/first-200km-07.jpg\" data-size=\"3169x1783\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/76/gallery/first-200km-07-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Last turn before the top of the Romontberg.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/76/gallery/first-200km-08.jpg\" data-size=\"4096x2304\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/76/gallery/first-200km-08-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Upper section of the Romontberg climb.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Romontberg.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>From 2015 to 2018, I took the first crack at riding 1x11 with SRAM Force CX1 on two different <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/old-gravel-bikes/\">bikes</a>. For most gravel rides, it was okay, but it lacked the gearing range with an 11-32T cassette. On very steep gravel climbs, I was missing a small gear, and on paved flats, I could have pushed a bigger gear. When I replaced my black Volagi Viaje CX with the Nordest Albarda, I went back to two chainrings up front. SRAM’s 1x12 <a href=\"https://www.sram.com/en/sram/xplr\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">XPLR drivetrain</a> in the flavors Red, Force, or Rival extends the <a href=\"https://www.sram.com/en/sram/xplr/xplr?filters=cattype|Cassettes&amp;sort=&amp;page=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cassette</a> both ways (10-44T). Combined with a 42T chainring, I now feel like I have the gear range to ride everywhere. Years ago, I preferred the tight gear steps of smaller cassettes. I no longer mind the larger gear jumps of a 12-speed XPLR cassette. I often didn’t find the right cog with the old 11-32T cassette in climbs. I don't seem to have that problem on the wider XPLR cassette now. It’s been such a positive experience that I’m going to convert my Nordest Albarda and my Volagi Viaje to 1x12 as well. The Nordest will be first at the end of the year. The Volagi will follow in the spring of 2024.</p>",

I started exploring things outside what is considered a “road bike.”</p>\n\n<p>Without fixation on grams and watts and without having to worry about keeping up in a group ride, my view on the “ideal” road bike has evolved. Today, I take a different approach to cycling and say “If it ain’t broke, break it.” The Volagi Viajes and the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/\">Nordest Albarda</a> were mostly about discovering wider tires and smaller wheels. I went from <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/40-is-the-new-28/\">28mm to 38mm</a> and landed at 48mm wide tires. To fit this tire width and to keep the bikes lively and agile, I swapped 700C wheels <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda-on-650b/\">for 650B</a>. The Nordest was a first sniff at a slacker frame geometry in combination with a lower bottom bracket. The Marin Gestalt X12 however, allowed me to throw everything I know overboard. It’s a gravel bike, unlike any other gravel bike I’ve ridden. It has a <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/the-geometry-of-a-gravel-bike/\">geometry</a> that heavily borrows from a modern mountain bike. Its head tube angle is slacker than any of my mountain bikes. It has a long reach, a short stem, and a long wheelbase. I also set it up with a wider handlebar than what I’ve ridden up to now.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-01.jpg\" data-size=\"3757x2113\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-01-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Marin Gestalt X12.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Marin Gestalt X12.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-04.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-04-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Rotor Aldhu crankset and Wolf Tooth chainring.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Oval chainring.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-02.jpg\" data-size=\"3512x1976\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-02-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Marin Gestalt X12 from the side.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Side shot.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-03.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-03-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Bottom bracket area.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Bottom bracket.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>Road.cc recently ran a feature on the rising cost of cycling.

On the gravel side of things, you have the <a href=\"https://www.specialized.com/ch/en/diverge-str-pro/p/200577\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">S-Works Diverge STR</a> with an SRAM Red/XX1 mullet setup setting you back CHF 10’000.00. As a young whippersnapper, I would have lusted over these financially out-of-reach bikes. Now in my mid-fifties, such outrageously expensive bikes no longer spark my interest. Could I afford one? Yeah, I could! Would I? No, that money is better invested in my retirement account. Cycling is more fun on equipment far cheaper than that. I would even argue that if you sell one of your kidneys for a high-end bike, you will never be honest with yourself about the quality of the bike. It will be the best bike you have owned, even if it causes you back pain and rides terribly. If an inexpensive bike turns out to be a poor fit, you will have no problem admitting it to yourself or your riding buddies.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-05.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-05-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Bottom bracket area from below.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>BB area.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-06.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-06-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"SRAM XPLR all-steel cassette.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>All-steel cassette.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-07.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-07-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"SRAM Rival XPLR AXS derailleur.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Rival derailleur.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-08.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-08-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Front hub and brake rotor.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Jagwire rotor.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The good news is that there are still companies out there that try to package fun into affordability. They do so without silly technical gimmicks or claimed aerodynamic improvements but with simple bikes that try nothing more than put a smile on a rider’s face. And when I’m on a bike that’s what truly counts, not grams and watts. One such company is <a href=\"https://www.marinbikes.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Marin</a>. As someone who got into mountain biking in the mid-eighties, Marin is a familiar name. The company has its roots in that era, and its bikes were quite popular at the time. To be honest, Marin sort of disappeared off my radar screen. One recent day, while googling for gravel bikes with slacker head tube angles, I came across Marin’s <a href=\"https://www.marinbikes.com/bikes/2023-gestalt-x10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2023 Gestalt X10</a>. I loved it at first sight. The frame geometry, the tube shapes, the tire clearance, the colors, and particularly the price. Browsing their whole catalog of bike offerings, I discovered that that’s what they do nowadays - affordable and attractive no-nonsense bikes for cyclists who cannot throw the entirety of their disposable incomes at their hobby.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"4\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-09.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-09-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Syntace FlatForce 44 stem.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Syntace stem.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-10.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-10-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Low and short.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Low and short.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-11.jpg\" data-size=\"3654x2055\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-11-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Syntace TwinFix mount.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>TwinFix.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-12.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x2268\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/67/gallery/marin-gestalt-x12-12-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Vincero Design edgePRO bottle mount.\" width=\"720\" height=\"405\"></a>\n<figcaption>Vincero edgePRO.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The Gestalt X10 can be purchased for CHF 1'629.00. At that price, it comes with mechanical disc brakes by Tektro, a MicroSHIFT Advent X 10-speed derailleur, and an aluminum handlebar, seat post, and rims. It’s not a bike that would catch anyone’s interest in Switzerland because none of the components say Shimano or SRAM. And without an additional zero to its price tag, it’s a cheap man’s bike in this nation anyway. In fact, when I contacted the bike shop about it, they said they wouldn’t stock it because of the mechanical disc brakes. Swiss cyclists apparently only want hydraulic brakes. While I prefer hydraulic disc brakes for the hilly Jura, I had two bikes with <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/search/?user_id=77168304%40N00&amp;view_all=1&amp;text=spyre\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TRP Spyre</a> brakes. On flat terrain, they performed just fine. The independent pad adjustment and the simple fact that you can maintain everything with a few Allen keys instead of a bleed kit still make such brakes a valid option. It’s a bit under-geared for me with a 42T chainring and an 11-51T SunRace cassette. I pulled off all the original components, which I’m keeping for the day I want to sell the bike. Instead of the OEM parts, I tuned it up with the components listed below. All in all, I spent CHF 3’200.00 to build the X10 into an X12. At the moment the X12 is set up with a <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/collideous/tags/nox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">7-year-old</a> Nox Composites Citico wheelset.

Its frame and fork had enough clearance for 40mm wide 700C tires and offered plenty of room for 650B <a href=\"https://www.wtb.com/collections/road-plus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">RoadPlus</a> tires. It was engineered for adventure. Many today equate adventure with bike-packing, so in this day and age, I would not view the Viaje as an ideal adventure bike. It lacks the many mounting points to carry bags, and the magnificent Long Bow Flex Stays cannot handle much more than the weight of the rider. I loved it, though, and I still do. Born in 2012, the Volagi Viaje had a fairly traditional road bike geometry. It rode like a road bike with a head angle of 72º, a BB drop of 70 mm, short chain stays, and a short wheelbase. It was agile and quick steering. It was fun on <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/gravel-grinding/\">gravel</a>, but I always had to pay attention to where it was going. This got even more pronounced when I built my third Viaje with 650B wheels. Equipped with smaller wheels, the Volagi Viaje tends to oversteer when leaning into a turn.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda/\">Nordest Albarda</a> I built in the fall of 2019 is a different machine. Nordest designed it more along the lines of a comfort bike. A semi-slack head tube angle of 70º and a high 74mm trail result in a bike with a lot of steering stability. One can more easily take the eyes off the road without immediately veering into the ditch. The 28mm longer front center is another good indicator of a well-mannered ride feel. Thanks to the short chainstays and extremely low bottom bracket the Albarda is by no means lethargic. It comes to life at speed. One thing to point out is that I went with a custom geometry because the stock geometry was a bit too upright for my taste. I ordered a medium frame with a 15mm shorter head tube - the head tube of a small. From October 2019 to March 2021, I rode the bike on 700C wheels. In the <a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/nordest-albarda-2021-update/\">spring of 2021</a>, I swapped the groupset from a 2x11-speed SRAM Red eTap HRD to a 2x12 Red AXS groupset and went 650B. This reduces the trail from 74mm to about 68mm and slightly lowers the wheel flop. And it is noticeable! Like the Volagi Viaje, I prefer the Nordest Albarda with 650B wheels.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-translation=\"Add images\" data-columns=\"5\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/Geometry-Comparison.webp\" data-size=\"2390x1280\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/Geometry-Comparison-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Geometry comparison.\" width=\"720\" height=\"386\"></a>\n<figcaption>Geometry comparison.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/Nordest-Albarda-Marin-Gestalt-X10.webp\" data-size=\"2250x1100\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/Nordest-Albarda-Marin-Gestalt-X10-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Nordest Albarda vs. Marin Gestalt X10\" width=\"720\" height=\"352\"></a>\n<figcaption>Nordest Albarda vs. Marin Gestalt X10</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/Volagi-Viaje-Marin-Gestalt-X10.webp\" data-size=\"2250x1100\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/Volagi-Viaje-Marin-Gestalt-X10-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Volagi Viaje vs. Marin Gestalt X10\" width=\"720\" height=\"352\"></a>\n<figcaption>Volagi Viaje vs. Marin Gestalt X10</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/Evil-Chamois-Hagar-Marin-Gestalt-X10.webp\" data-size=\"2250x1100\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/Evil-Chamois-Hagar-Marin-Gestalt-X10-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Evil Chamois Hagar vs. Marin Gestalt X10\" width=\"720\" height=\"352\"></a>\n<figcaption>Evil Chamois Hagar vs. Marin Gestalt X10</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/easton-ax-handlebar-measurements.webp\" data-size=\"1000x735\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://offtrail.guru/media/posts/75//gallery/easton-ax-handlebar-measurements-thumbnail.webp\" alt=\"Easton AX handlebar measurements.\" width=\"720\" height=\"529\"></a>\n<figcaption>Handlebar measurements.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.marinbikes.com/bikes/2023-gestalt-x10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">2023 Marin Gestalt X10</a> is a whole different beast. The vast majority of gravel bikes are essentially nothing more than road bikes with room for large tires. The Marin X10 and XR, on the other hand, borrow a lot from modern mountain bikes. And that's why I pulled the trigger and got one. So, what about that geometry? The most eye-popping differences are head tube angle, reach, and a dramatically elongated front-center as a combination of the two. To keep my position, I shortened the stem from 110/100 mm (Viaje/Albarda) to 44 mm. I mounted a wider handlebar to better deal with the very high trail figure and the increased wheel flop. It’s an <a href=\"https://eastoncycling.com/products/ec70-ax-bar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Easton EC70 AX</a> in 46 cm. With a 16º flare, the bar has 53 cm in the drops. Maybe also to note, based on Marin’s sizing chart, I’m smack in between an M and an L. I went with a large. The next couple of weeks will show if Marin is onto something with such an MTB-inspired, hard-charging, rough-and-rowdy gravel/adventure bike.</p>",
