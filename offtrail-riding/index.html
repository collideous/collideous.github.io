But it was no David. Over the last five years it's been my winter snow monster which occasionally got to see dirt throughout the season. The mind-blowing grip and traction of 4+ inch tires started changing my mountain adventures. Such tires are simply underchallenged on man-made trails. Over the last two years, I challenged them and myself to tackle the wild, mountainous terrain away from trails. I call this offtrail mountain-biking and I have been doing it ever more frequently.<br><br>This is something obviously not unproblematic. In many parts of the world, mountain bikers have to fight for trail access. They would immediately be kicked out of parks if they'd ride their bikes offtrail. Here in Switzerland this type of riding wouldn't be possible in large parts of the country. I'm sort of lucky to live at the foot of a mountain range without many rules. It's a somewhat lawless region for historical reasons. The people of the Jura had always been governed by the canton of Berne and only gained independence in 1979 by forming their own canton. Still today, there are separatist movements in the communes bordering both cantons. The people of this sparsely populated region hated to be told by Berne what they could or couldn't do, so they have a far more laissez-faire approach than others today. Take snowmobiling for instance. It's prohibited for recreational purposes in the whole country, yet there's a snowmobile club in my region and my fat-bike backyard gets crisscrossed by snowmobile riders all winter long. No local police officer would ever bother to chase the offenders down. Secondly, the whole region is economically used. The woods are regularly logged with heavy machinery and the pastures are cattle land. It doesn't need to be said that one has to stay away from nature-sanctuaries. Such places are off-limits to any kind of offtrail activity. The majority of the hills though, a fantastic playground for a lonely offtrail explorer.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 27, 2020</p><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://collideous.github.io/tags/cycling/">cycling</a></li><li><a href="https://collideous.github.io/tags/fat-biking/">fat biking</a></li><li><a href="https://collideous.github.io/tags/offtrail-riding/">offtrail riding</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><img class="bio__avatar" src="https://collideous.github.io/media/website/profile.picture.jpg" loading="lazy" alt="Patrick Strahm"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://collideous.github.io/authors/patrick-strahm/" class="invert" rel="author">Patrick Strahm</a></h3><p>Mountains are not stadiums where I satisfy my ambition to achieve, they are the cathedrals where I practice my religion.</p></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://collideous.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://collideous.github.io/making-tools-for-a-bearing-swap/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Making Tools For A Bearing Swap</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://collideous.github.io/custom-carbon-front-light-mount/" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Custom Carbon Front Light Mount </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://collideous.github.io/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__comments"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5">Comments</h2><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
